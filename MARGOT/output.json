Like a literal dog, not a who's top dog or whatever you want to call it. Having said that, the movie is brooding, slow paced (turtle or snail if you need an animal to compare it to rather than a dogs pace) and quite character driven.Not all intentions are clear from the beginning. There is a lot hidden and there is a lot that we may not understand after watching it the first time around. The pain Cumberbatchs character suffers with - the agony and all the other emotions that make him (seem) bitter. And then there is the dog ... I mean son. He seems to be ... drawn to men. Does that play a role? Or is it even true? Does that still make him a mamas boy? No pun intended. He clearly has a mind of his own.And while you cannot see into his mind ... I think you will figure out eventually what his goals are. As flawed as a mother can be ... she still is ones mother ... someone we protect from others. And we all have different ways and means to achieve just that ... and with that I will leave you with a movie that is not a western in the traditional sense.

{"review": "The shadow of Bronco Henry hovers over the story and the characters of \"The Power of the Dog\". He's long dead when the picture opens, but the story reveals that he was a mentor to the Burbank Brothers, the caustic and abusive Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch), and the more reserved, almost timid George (Jesse Plemons). When the story revealed a well guarded secret regarding Phil's sexuality, I had to wonder if the relationship he began pursuing with Peter Gordon (Kodi Smit-McPhee) was influenced by lonely days on the trail between Bronco Henry and the reclusive cowboy.There's also the early mention of Peter's promise to keep his mother Rose (Kirsten Dunst) safe, after his alcoholic father committed suicide by hanging. While both Peter and George appear to be ineffective against Phil's taunts and bursts of bravado, an undercurrent of payback begins to evolve, even if it's not readily apparent at the outset. Though Peter appears to be somewhat effete in his mannerisms, he has no qualms about snapping a rabbit's neck to put it out of misery. When Peter sees a barking dog in the shadow of a mountain range, it arouses a spark of sensitivity in Phil, who up until then felt that he alone had this mysterious insight into things unseen by others.The tease of a homo-erotic encounter between Phil and Peter is ever present in the latter half of the picture, just as a final confrontation is expected between the two very different brothers. Instead, the picture offers a deliciously ambiguous ending, leaving the viewer with a reason to contemplate the death of Phil Burbank. As an aspiring medical student, Peter certainly knew how to handle the anthrax-diseased steer that he encountered on the range. So one has to decide whether the transference of the virulent bacteria to the cut on Phil's hand was intentional or inadvertent. I'm pretty sure I know the answer to that one, but the engaged viewer will have to decide on one's own.I didn't give it any thought while watching, but another reviewer on this board suggested the film as an Oscar contender. In a year with a dearth of exceptional films, I have to consider that the idea might have some merit. Benedict Cumberbatch's performance is broodingly forceful, with more than capable support from Plemons, Smit-McPhee and Dunst. I have to think it might be a surprise contender.", "helpfulness": 0.7422680412371134}

We don't know how long \"George\" and \"Rose\" have been friends, but next thing we know they are married and the pretty unpleasant \"Phil\" sets out to make her life as miserable as possible. He is never overtly cruel - there is no violence, but mental abuse that sends her seeking solace in the bottle. When her son joins them from school, he fixes him fairly and squarely in his sights too - introducing a hint of homo-eroticism and scheming to the last fifteen minutes that makes you sit up. Again, no action as such - there are no gunfights or fisticuffs, just a cleverly structured denouement that I felt fitting. The pace is really slow, the dialogue pretty laconic, Cumberbatch's accent is all over the place and the score becomes wearisome after a while - the sounds of the constant high pitched violins really did begin to grate.

{"review": "Two brothers born into wealth and privilege take over their family's cattle ranch in the wilds of 1923 Montana. One of them (Jessie Plemons) conducts himself the way you'd think a college educated man would. The other (Benedict Cumberbatch), despite having a degree from Yale, struts around like an alpha dog, staying dirty and stinky on purpose because he thinks that proves something about himself.Into this dynamic comes Kirsten Dunst, Plemons' new wife, and her gentle, effeminate son (played by Kodi Smit-McPhee in the film's best performance). We think this movie is going to be about Cumberbatch terrorizing this unwanted female and her sissy son, a sort of cross between \"Giant\" and \"There Will Be Blood,\" until something really unpleasant happens. But writer/director Jane Campion has other things on her mind. Something, or many, unpleasant things happen, or maybe they're not so unpleasant depending on your point of view. But I guarantee that at least some of them won't be the things you're expecting.\"The Power of the Dog\" reinforces what I already knew -- male macho posturing and bullying is usually a desperate attempt to disguise feelings of inadequacy and self doubt. Though set in 1923, the film is so clearly about now, and I was all in for a movie where the character who has reason and science at his back proves himself to be far stronger than the character who huffs and puffs like the big bad wolf.

{"review": "Greetings again from the darkness. Don't mess with the smart ones, as brains often outlast brawn. I'm conflicted on how best to describe this film. Perhaps ... It's nuanced storytelling at its finest. Jane Campion won an original screenplay Oscar for THE PIANO (1993), while also becoming only the second woman to receive a nomination as Best Director. This is her 8th feature film to direct, and the first since the underrated BRIGHT STAR (2009). Ms. Campion is such a smooth filmmaker, and her latest is so expertly crafted and so beautifully filmed, that some may find themselves not recognizing the underlying tension between characters. I urge you to remain diligent and take note of the subtle gestures and facial expressions, as the emotions run deep.Benedict Cumberbatch stars as Phil Burbank. He runs a successful cattle ranch with his brother George, played by Jesse Plemons. Though they sleep in the same room and have been driving cattle together for 25 years, the brothers couldn't be less alike. George is a soft-spoken man with few needs or aspirations other than wishing to not grow old alone. He lives in the shadow of his formidable brother, an educated man with a domineering personality. Phil is constantly proving how tough and macho he is by bullying others, even calling his more sensitive brother \"Fatso\". That thundering you hear is Phil purposefully slamming his heels into the wood floors so that his spurs never stop jangling.Phil is playing a game that only he knows the rules to. George bows his head in shame as he hears Phil belittle the frail and effeminate teenage Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee), who is waiting on their table at the Red Mill. Peter's widowed mother Rose (Kirsten Dunst) owns the place, and after George provides some comfort to her, George and Rose secretly marry. Viewing this as a personal affront, Phil is merciless in his cruelty towards Rose and Peter. It turns out that Phil is masquerading as one thing in order to hide another truth. An intriguing sequence (that is so well acted I could watch it 10 times) leads to a warming of the relationship between Phil and Peter. The two bond over horseback riding, rope-braiding, and stories of Phil's now-deceased 'mentor', Bronco Henry.This setting is 1925 Montana, though it's filmed in New Zealand. The majestic mountain range constantly looms on the horizon. Yet despite the beauty, it's a tough life made tougher by Phil's menacing behavior - psychological torturing of Rose that leads her to the bottle - something that clearly holds unfavorable memories. The four leads are truly outstanding, and supporting work is provided by Thomasin McKenzie as the young housekeeper, and Keith Carradine, Frances Conroy, Allison Bruce, and Peter Carroll as uncomfortable guests at a dinner party.Jonny Greenwood provides the music. It's not so much a score as it is mood-enhancing messaging through guitars, violins, and pianos - each piece delivering just the right note. Cinematographer Ari Wegner (THE TRUE HISTORY OF THE KELLY GANG, 2019) works seamlessly with director Campion to capture the shifts in tone and the minutiae of the performances. An early shot through the kitchen windows captures Phil strutting through the ranch. The shot is repeated later with a contrasting look. The film is based on the 1967 novel by Thomas Savage, and it includes some of his personal experiences. Nothing haunts us more than the lingering effect of words Peter provides as narration near the film's opening, when he informs us that a real man must save his mother. Oh yes, this is nuanced storytelling at its finest. By the way, you know how to whistle, don't you?Streaming on Netflix.", "helpfulness": 0.6666666666666666}
{"review": "\"Bronco Henry told me that a man was made by patience in the odds against him.\" Phil Burbank (Benedict Cumberbatch)It's 1925 in the wilds of Montana, and Phil Burbank patiently raises cattle with his brother George (Jesse Plemons). As different as the two centuries, George is a genteel new kind of cowboy where Phil carries the rugged wild West with a secret that makes him more 20th than 19th century.Into their robust, masculine ranch come the outsiders, who in literature and film usually change things. Rose Gordon (Kirsten Dunst), new bride of George, and her effeminate son, Peter (Kodi Smidt-McPhee), come to live at the ranch. Phil initially accepts neither, but soon takes a paternal attitude toward the boy.The new West has secrets of a progressive nature in Phil's hiding smut magazines of nude men and of an ancient nature with Rose's alcoholism. The worlds are bound to collide as they both hide their secrets, and the boy begins to take bolder action in defense of his mother against Phil.Unlike the Old West, this modern one is not about guns but rather cattle and changing sexual mores. The latter proves to be a game changer for everyone as they adjust to the reversal of their notions about masculinity and the emerging role of women. Director Jane Campion, as she did in The Piano, lets her camera linger on the outward expressions of inner struggle and the vast landscape, which promises to bury one's secrets, but doesn't.Campion has crafted an art film despite the vast plains and mountains by concentrating on the individual actors to tell their stories from the way they look at each other to the way they ride a horse, or don't. The homoeroticism, more pronounced in Brokeback Mountain, lies under the raw masculine, everyday display. While the testosterone is amply present in the recent The Harder They Fall, also a Netflix film, it is muted in this modern everyday life, waiting to be upended by the authentic expression of desire no matter the sexes involved.The Power of the Dog is a high-class film set in the high plains of early 20th century Montana. The themes of love, sexuality, and allegiance are carefully drawn by the accomplished director, who honors her story with a patience and insight matched only by the majesty of the setting.

{"review": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningMontana, 1925. Phil Burbank (Benedict Cumberbatch) is an esteemed rancher, who still carries a sadness over the death of his friend, Bronco, fairly soon after it happened. His brother George (Jesse Plemons), who is dominated by him, strikes up a romance with widower Rose Gordon (Kirsten Dunst), but she is belittled and rejected by Phil, along with her inward son Peter (Kodi-Smit McPhee), who is not traditionally masculine, but eventually Phil warms to him, unaware of the dark secret Peter will bring to the surface.I never saw The Piano, the film that has defined the career of Jane Campion, or any of her other films for that matter, so I was unsure what kind of presentational style to expect from The Power of the Dog, the highly publicised new film of hers that has premiered on Netflix. A slow burning, reflective character study, of a time and place, defined by what came to be seen as traditional masculine roles, but shining a light at what went on under the surface, that is surprising as well as humane in its revelation.The most striking thing about it ostensibly is the all star cast, headed by Cumberbatch, delivering a performance of subdued, internalised ferociousness just simmering at the surface, as a man callously seeking out to destroy that which he cannot understand or control, with some revelatory support from the likes of Dunst, Plemons, and Smit-McPhee, as a quietly sinister and disturbed young man, with a hidden ability to search beneath the surface of someone with a strong front.Cumberbatch has plugged it as an examination of toxic masculinity, and that's what it is, probing of an archetype of the traditional masculine man, and the folly his stubborn pride causes. ****", "helpfulness": 0.4186046511627907}
{"review": "I hope the uncalled for comparisons with \"Heaven's Gate\" and, for that matter, \"Brokeback Mountain\" don't hurt the chances of \"The Power of the Dog\" doing well, either at the box-office or come awards season. This is Jane Campion's first feature film since \"Bright Star\" twelve years ago and it may be a masterpiece. It's a 'contemporary' western in that it's set in 1925 and is about two brothers, both ranchers, one 'good', (Jesse Plemons), and one 'bad', (Benedict Cumberbatch), and what happens when Plemons brings home a new wife, (Kirsten Dunst), and her teenage son, (Kodi Smit-McPhee).It's a slow, visually stunning, (Ari Wegner is the DoP), character-driven piece written by Campion from Thomas Savage's novel and it deals with both the themes of revenge and redemption. Cumberbatch may appear to be the conventional villain but it's clear quite early on there are a great deal more shadings to his character and Cumberbatch is superb in a role he took over from Paul Dano. Plemons, on the other hand, never quite develops beyond being the decent family man though both Dunst and Smit-McPhee are excellent.You could say the other major 'character' in the film is the house where they live. A great gothic pile standing in the middle of nowhere, (the film was shot in the vast open spaces of New Zealand standing in for Montana), this house is as memorable as those in \"Giant\" and \"Days of Heaven\". As with all of Campion's films nothing here is rushed. This is no more an action film than something Terrence Malick might turn out, (Malick is another point of reference), and consequently will be more suited to the art-house than the multiplex but in its simple, direct and unadorned way it's as good as anything you will see this year and it shouldn't be missed.", "helpfulness": 0.5064102564102564}
{"review": "Powered by strong performances from its sturdy cast, The Power of the Dog is a slow-burn western drama about what it means to be a man and is brought to life with both patience & gentleness. An assured piece of soulful storytelling that's all the more elevated by exquisite camerawork & flaring score, the film dissects masculinity, power & fragility with a firm hand.Written & directed by Jane Campion, this is my first stint with her works and what stood out for me is her willingness to capture the warmth & humanity in every character regardless of their intrinsic nature. With the vast landscapes of New Zealand serving as backdrop for the film's Old West setting, the story is allowed to unfurl at its own pace & comfort and offers a quiet, absorbing drama.But then, even though the storytelling on display has its qualities, it is the actors who do the heavy lifting. Benedict Cumberbatch renders on screen a persona who's both intimidating & awe-inspiring yet is at his finest when giving us a glimpse into his vulnerability. It is arguably his career-best act, plus he finds brilliant support from Jesse Plemons, Kirsten Dunst & Kodi Smit-McPhee who all do well to hold their own.Overall, The Power of the Dog addresses love, hurt, loneliness & repressed desire through the unraveling of a formidable rancher and the psychosexual tension that exists in between him & a young man under his wing. Its modest premise, slow pace, soft approach & silent treatment won't satisfy every palate but there's a purity to its emotions & authenticity in its presentation that effortlessly manages to stand out.

{"review": "If you're like me and knew very little about Thomas Savage's 1967 novel on which New Zealand filmmaker Jane Campion's newest film is based upon, it's very likely that Netflix's The Power of the Dog will become one of the year's most unsettling and unnerving film watching experiences for the unsuspecting viewer.An on face value familiar western like set up centered around Benedict Cumberbatch's and Jesse Plemons Montana ranching brothers Phil and George Burbank, polar opposites who find their paths diverging further when George marries Kirstin Dunst's Rose Gorden whose teenage child Peter is an odd one out in a very masculine fueled landscape, this 1925 set drama is a feverishly nightmarish vision of time, place and characters that slow burns its way into your subconscious that leads you too one of the years most memorable finales.Her first feature film since 2009's rather forgettable Bright Star (with the magnificent first season of Top of the Lake in between), the Oscar winning Campion has a field day exploring the fractured psyche of her lead four piece against the picturesque backdrop of Montana (in fact the director's home country) with the examination of Cumberbatch's at times detestable and other times sad Phil and Kodi Smit-McPhee's Peter key to what type of ominous and unexpected vibes the film establishes in its second half as the initial focus around George and Rose fades into the background.What at first appears to be a relatively straight forward narrative of warring brothers becoming divided over one another's priorities, with Phil obsessed with the grunt work of everyday farming life and his memories of the brothers mentor Bronco Henry while being content to live a solitary banjo playing/mud path taking existence and George keener to wine and dine with governor's and ensure his wife has a fine piano, Dog slowly but surely morphs into something else entirely that may alienate some viewers and captivate others with a tone not to dissimilar to classic oil drama There Will be Blood.Not everything clicks in Campion's odd, at times frustrating and other times captivating tale, with the characters of George and Rose feeling only ever half-explored at best with Plemon's in particular given short shift once the half way mark of the film rolls around but when this beautifully shot and scored film hits its mark and the award worthy performances of Cumberbatch and McPhee (both arguably never better) take hold, there's a unique power in Campion's feature that will cause it too linger long in the memory as you dissect its many themes and angles.Arguably Netflix's greatest chance at securing pieces of Oscar glory at the upcoming awards season, it's hard too know exactly where Dog may sit in the conversation months down the track but whatever may end up being the case, its great to see Campion back behind the camera again and creating incendiary works that established her as one of the most influential directing voices of the 90's.Final Say -A far from stereotypical western that is challenging, confronting, nightmarish and undeniably bizarre, The Power of the Dog won't be for everyone but when the dust settles after its credits have rolled, it becomes a film that is hard to shake from your thoughts.4 rose petals out of 5.", "helpfulness": 0.47761194029850745}

The great star of this film is the Montana High Prairie, butting into the hills and bluffs which sidle up to the Rockies. Herds of cattle trek along a ridge with the continental divide and the Montana big skies behind them. This and the concentration on nature be it rabbits, deer, horses, cattle or even humans in all of their strengths and frailities is highlighted by the cinematography of Ari Wegner. TPOTD will soon stream on Netflix but is worth watching on a big screen to fully appreciate these vistas. Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) and George (Jesse Plemon)s are brothers in their 40s, they run a ranch and are close, sharing a bedroom even though they live in a large house. Phil is rough and uncouth in contrast to the mannered George who dresses as a prosperous rancher even when working. Phil upsets the sensitive Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee) a waiter at his mother Rose's (Kirsten Dunst) eating house. George is taken to Rose and they end up marrying. Phil resents this and makes life a misery for Rose, literally driving her to drink. Peter, now at medical school comes to the ranch for summer and is mocked by Phil and his ranch hand cronies. After an incident Phil seems to take a shine to Peter though.A film of powerful emotions, maternal love, filial loyalty and more dominate the film. Phil worships the memory of Bronco Henry who taught him all that he knows about ranching, he even keeps Henry's saddle as a shrine. His dislike of Rose extends to misogyny , the reasons for this ar payed out as the narrative unfolds. Phil's secrets explain some of this, he carries out rituals in a hidden creek, part of his life is suppressed. Rose's strengths are undermined not just by Phil but by her own actions when drunk. George's ambitions are also hampered by Phil's bitterness. The interplay of tensions is literally Shakespearean as the egos clash and Peter reveals unexpected strengths.

{"review": "Jane Campion's movies are very much hit or miss... actually, most of them are a miss because, regardless of the plot, they offer fantastic sceneries coupled with total lack of tension. Once again we find here some magnificent landscapes, if you are into desolated, jagged hills and houses lost in the middle of nowhere and unsympathetic, dull characters who can hardly string a couple of words together.The plot is about wealthy, arrogant, bad-mannered Phil who resents Rose, his brother's George wife. Rose is a widow with a grownup son named Peter, and she might have married George out of interest. Is that any of Phil's business? Clearly it isn't, but we should buy into the fact that Phil is so angry and therefore so nasty to Rose that she turns into an alcoholic because of her mental anguish.When Peter moves to the brother's ranch, the tale takes a weird homoerotic turn, as in gay cowboy porn - but stylish - with plenty of male naked buttocks and glittering muscles; unfortunately, not even that manages to inject a sparkle of vitality. Think about a mix between Giant and Brokeback Mountain, but ten times slower and with stilted dialogues interspersed by long silences.PS the story is supposed to take place in Montana around 1925, but it was filmed in New Zealand and it definitely conveys more Lord of the Rings vibes than any western you've ever seen. Also despicable is the cruelty to animals. I know stuff like that goes on, but I don't need to witness it, thank you very much Ms. Campion for sticking to brutality between people.", "helpfulness": 0.704225352112676}

When his brother brings home a new wife and her son, Phil torments them until he finds himself exposed to the possibility of love.If you are expecting a typical western than you are going to be disappointed. This is only a western because of its setting. The story could have been set at any place or time period .It's an extremely slow burner .

{"review": "The most inclusive movie of the MCU yet - and while I didn't keep count, after the first Captain America movie, this is the first that has an overall serious tone to it. That being said, there is still a lot of humor in it. Especially Kumail and his ... \"sidekick\" cover most of the jokes. Which may be the reason he is AWOL at a certain point in time (you'll know which moment that is) - you can hold that against the movie or just go with the flow.Which is true for the inclusiveness too - and I am not even talking about the very first erotic scene of the MCU. Don't get too excited (or upset), it is quite tame, but might still be reason for kids to be asking some questions (they are just cuddling like we do - could be a possible answer I reckon). You also have the inclusion of a homosexual character - the movie does not make a big deal out of it. There is a tender male on male kiss. Hopefully you are not someone who is offended by such things and open minded.All these things have nothing to do with any \"superhero\" powers (I reckon you can and probably most will call the Eternals superheroes) ... so the movie is quite packed. So much acting talent in front of the camera, so much creative and technical wizardry behind the camera. So there is a point to be made that this could have easily been a Disney Plus show. Who knows, maybe there will be an Eternals inspired Disney Plus show. Could be after the movie plays or in between the arrival of the Eternals and \"Present Day\" (I always wonder what that must look like decades after this was made - anyway). Actually after I wrote this, I read somewhere that they are thinking about making a show and filling in the \"gaps\".There are certain elements that can be considered cliche, but that would be quite the nitpicking, if you went down that road. Chloe Zhao really held her own and was able to reign in everyone and make a really good movie. This will impress you, especially on a big screen (like on an Imax screen). Because it is different in many ways, this may be viewed more favorably in the future with more context or different expectations.We're still early on in Phase 4 and some may have a better understanding or can guess where the MCU might be heading next. I am talking about fans, I am quite certain Kevin Feige and some others do know of course. At least vaguely. 2,5 hours long and never felt boring or too much. If anything it felt like too little. For what it is (ensemble), it is really well made and condensed.Yes there are logic issues (where were they all this time? Why didn't they appear earlier and so forth?) ... they are adressed of course, but would not really withstand a smell test. But if you are invested in the MCU, the question is: do you really mind? Also this can be seen and watched without any knowledge of anything that came before ... but as always it is way better enjoyed if you have seen the things that came before.Interestingly enough characters from the DC (universe) are being mentioned, like Batmans Alfred or even Superman. So there does not seem to be a mean spirited thought behind that. More like an acknowledgment and a nod to the other universe, that has created so many great stories and characters too. And an admission, but also acknowledgment to the audience and their feelings and intelligence. There is not a void - this could be our universe ... maybe a parallel universe that works that way ... wouldn't that be a great thought/thing to have? And who are we to say that it isn't possible? With Spiderman coming up next - the door will be smashed rather than kicked in - and I am really looking forward to that one - hoping to be able to watch it before my social media feed is full of people talking about the movie. I like to know as little as possible - enjoying the movie on a different, more surprising level. Until then, don't forget: there are two bonus scenes (mid and after credit), like with most MCU movies here.", "helpfulness": 0.36904761904761907}
{"review": "I have never missed an entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, especially with the story continuing in each film, this was the twenty-sixth film in the franchise, Mark Kermode didn't give it the best review, but I was always going to watch it, directed by Chlo\u00e9 Zhao (Nomadland). Basically, in 5000 BC, a race of immortal beings, the Eternals, were sent by the Celestial Arishem (David Kaye) on their starship, the Domo, to the planet Earth. The ten superpowered heroes are Ajak (Salma Hayek), Sersi (Humans' Gemma Chan), Ikaris (Bodyguard's Richard Madden), Kingo (The Big Sick's Kumail Nanjiani), Sprite (Lia McHugh), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Druig (Dunkirk's Barry Keoghan), Gilgamesh (Don Lee, aka Ma Dong-seok), and Thena (Angelina Jolie). The Eternals exterminated the invasive monstrous race of near-immortal beings called the Deviants. The last of the Deviants are killed in 1521, but the group have varied opinions over their continued responsibilities and their relationship with humankind. Over the next five hundred years, they mostly live apart from each other, awaiting Arishem's return. In the present day, Sersi and Sprite live together in London. Sersi was left by her partner Ikaris centuries ago, so she now in a relationship with human Dane Whitman (Game of Thrones' Kit Harington), who works at the Natural History Museum. Sersi, Sprite and Dane are attacked by the Deviant Kro (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd), until Ikaris arrives and chases the creature away. Realising the Deviants have returned, they travel to South Dakota to reunite with their leader, Ajak, only to find that she had been killed. Sersi is posthumously chosen by Ajak as her successor, granting her the ability to communicate with Arishem, who reveals that the mission of the Eternals was not to fight the Deviants but to prepare Earth for the \"Emergence\". Arishem explains that for millions of years, the Celestials, an ancient race of entities, have been planting their seeds on populated planets for new Celestials to be born. The Celestials sent the Deviants o destroy the apex predators of each planet to ensure the development of life. However, the Deviants evolved and began to hunt the planets' native populations, so the Eternals were created by the Celestials to cull them. With the reversal of the Blip (Thanos wiping out half of all living things in the universe), Earth has reached the necessary population for the birth of the Celestial Tiamut, which will result in Earth's destruction. The Eternals have come to love humanity and reassemble, deciding to prevent the Emergence. They reconvene with Kingo, Thena, and Gilgamesh before heading to Druig's residence in the Amazon rainforest, where they are attacked by Kro and the Deviants. Kro kills Gilgamesh before fleeing. After cremating him, they visit Phastos, who proposes for Druig to put Tiamut to sleep by amplifying his mind-control powers with the Uni-Mind, a connection between all the Eternals. Ikaris reveals that Ajak informed him of the Emergence centuries before, he chose to remain loyal to Arishem, and allowed Ajak to be killed by the Deviants six days ago to prevent her from stopping it. Sprite, who has an unrequited love for him, joins Ikaris as he flees. Kingo also leaves the group as he does not wish to face Arishem or fight his teammates. Makkari locates the place of the Emergence at the foot of an active volcano in the Indian Ocean. The Eternals battle Ikaris and Sprite before Kro appears and attacks. Thena kills Kro, and Druig knocks out Sprite after she attempts to kill Sersi. The remaining Eternals work together to subdue Ikaris while Phastos activates the Uni-Mind. Ikaris breaks free of his restraints, but cannot bring himself to kill Sersi, because he still loves her. Sersi uses her matter transmutation abilities to turn Tiamut to marble. Ikaris feeling highly guilty flies into the Sun, while Sersi uses the remaining energy from the Uni-Mind to end Sprite's permanent childlike state and turn into a human. Thena, Druig, and Makkari depart on the Domo to find other Eternals, while Sersi, Phastos, Kingo, and Sprite remain on Earth. Dane reunites with Sersi and is about to reveal a secret about his family history when she, along with Phastos and Kingo, are remotely dragged into space. They are brought before Arishem, who states his displeasure with their treason, but elects to spare humanity if the Eternals' memories prove that humans are worthy of living. Vowing to return for judgment, he disappears into a singularity, taking the trio with him. Meanwhile, Thena, Makkari, and Druig are visited by the Eternal Eros aka Starfox (Harry Styles), brother of Thanos, and his assistant Pip the Troll (Patton Oswalt), who offer their help. Dane is seen opening an old chest inherited from his ancestors that contains the legendary Ebony Blade, an unseen person (voiced by Mahershala Ali) questions if he is ready for it. Also starring Harish Patel as Karun, Haaz Sleiman as Phastos' husband Ben, and Esai Daniel Cross as Phastos' son Jack. The all-star cast, including Chan, Madden, Hayek and Jolie are all reliable, I agree that there is a lot going on, making it hard to keep up in certain moments, but what the film lacks in solid script and character development it makes up for in other aspects. It has good diversity, using many races and cultures, including a deaf character and a same-sex relationship, and it delivers on the witty moments of humour, and of course the spectacular fight and chase sequences, complete with brilliant special effects, adding up to a satisfactory superhero fantasy action.

{"review": "The premiss here is quite fun - 7,000 years ago a diverse race of immortals arrive on Earth to protect the population from a monstrous race of \"Deviants\" who are bent on eating us all up. Their \"Prime Directive\", if you will, is that they must not interfere in human conflict, so once they have cleared away the beasties, they split up and lead separate lives. That is, until \"Sersi\" (Gemma Chan), her pal \"Sprite\" (Lia McHugh) and her beau \"Dane\" (Kit Harrington) are set upon in London by a newly empowered creature only to be rescued by \"Ikaris\" (Richard Madden) - and that incident forces them all to reassemble. Pretty soon they discover the body of their erstwhile leader \"Ajak\" (Selma Hayek) and must now combine their forces to thwart their ever strengthening enemy and learn why they have resurfaced. Unfortunately, what now follows is a stunning looking, but really pretty dull series of set-piece scenarios that rather clunkily combine mythology and melodrama, romance and action. The camera loves Madden, but as an actor - even clad in blue leather - he is little better than a handsome man. Kumail Nanjiani (\"KIngo\") has a soup\u00e7on of charisma, but the rest of the cast including the really out of place Angelina Jolie (\"Thena\") and Harish Patel (\"Karun\") who is intent on videoing everthing at considerable risk to himself, really offer little by way of characterisation and the attempts at humour misfire most of the time. The story has some great effects, but so what? That's what we expect from the most mediocre of productions nowadays. What was needed here were far fewer actors and a much more robust story - and, yes, it could probably have lost the half an hour spent justifying the enormous budget in far-lung locations (real and imaginary). There's a final scene midway through the credits that really does not bode well for the sequel either.

{"review": "I'm not going to give a long winded review though the movie was long. \"Eternal\" was the runtime. There were parts that were good and parts that weren't. One of the biggest issues is that a movie of this nature presents more questions than it answers. The very existence of eternal beings existing on planet Earth, sent there by their creator in order to protect human life from Deviants, begs a lot of questions. And the more they strayed from their prime directive, the more questions they presented. The eternals were human in every aspect with the exception of their powers and their lifespan. The fact that such humanlike and very fallible beings (as in not entirely obedient) were sent to protect humans is just a start of the questions.\"Eternals\" was unnecessarily long. There were plenty of scenes that could've been left on the cutting room floor. Marvel bit off a lot with this metaphysical, beginning of creation movie. It was very emotional and slow at many points. Even the comic relief failed to garner the laughs it intended. But, there was applause in the theater after it was over.

{"review": "For 7000 years, 10 aliens have lived among us. Their powers are immense. They are here to protect us from the Deviants, apex predators who we could never defeat on our own. However, their makers, the Celestials, have ordered them not to interfere with our development. After The Snap, something is different, and they may have to go against what they have been told.So, this is a lot to take in. Which is why the movie opens with a text crawl, and a lot of it is characters talking, discussing. I understand why some people feel that this bogs the movie down, that the pacing is lethargic. With that said, I simply cannot agree with them. This is never less than deeply compelling. Chloe Zhao embodies what Roger Ebert(RIP) meant, when he referred to films(as a medium) as \"empathy machines\". It is astonishing that she manages to find humanity(and so much, at that) in all of these super beings, who should be completely impossible to relate to, for any audience member(vampires don't *actually* exist, right?).The MCU is maturing. This is easily the most philosophical, downright existential, entry in the over two dozen series(which, just to be clear, I'm a huge fan of, have been from the very start). Smartly, it is very friendly to newcomers, and you really do not need to have watched any of the others in order to follow this. It makes you think, feel, and stays with you long after the two incredible post credit scenes have played. Honestly, a number of people will be moved to tears by the relationships depicted in this. I came quite close, myself. The diversity in casting, in languages spoken(and signed), all the civilizations and ethnicities shown, underlining that we humans are all one race, our world and problems the same. The sheer fact that this doesn't come across as cheesy and preachy is deeply impressive. This features beautiful cinematography, location shooting and every action scene is emotionally engaging in addition to exciting and cool looking.There is a lot of violence, much of it against creatures, a little moderate to strong language and brief sexuality in this.

This is their only job: they are not to interfere in human affairs. They wipe the Deviants out and then go their seperate ways, waiting to be recalled to their home planet. Then a Deviant appears...I enjoyed this and the eye candy is splendid, the action is beautifully choreographed. But it is one of the weaker offerings, and here is why.There are too many new characters and you don't get the chance to know them. This means you don't get emotionally invested in them. Yes, you care about whether xyz global crisis happens, but you don't really care about the relationships between the Eternals. A number of character-based subplots are introduced but never really go anywhere. The thing about the MCU is that you got to genuinely care about each character, which is why the deaths in Avengers 3 and 4 were so devastating. That is not the case here.Also, it is longer than it needs to be, to no purpose, and although the story is simple, it is unnecessarily complicated in the telling.Again, I enjoyed it, but it is probably 2nd or 3rd from the bottom of my list.

The plot is okay, but it did drag and shoot, am I tired of hearing excuses when MCU introduces new Super-Human characters who were around for wars, including the Infinity War, and did nothing to help/prevent it. Either you need to reboot everything or make origin stories set in present day only. Finally, I 100% hated the inclusion of a particular reference in regards to comparing the lead male Eternal, Ikaris to another superhero.Overall, it's absolutely not the worst MCU movie, but it fits nowhere in the top half best.

It feels very \"adult\" in so many ways. But in others, it's childish. The story is a complete mess. So many useless side plots. The characters feel flat, especially the protagonist. Some uncharacteristically bad casting choices (while also criminally under utilizing Angelina Jolie, a beast of an actress, should have been the main character). So much of this movie doesn't feel natural, something always feels a bit off.There's a lot i enjoyed. I watched some of the coolest things I've ever seen on screen. So many parts are visually stunning. Some of the action was good, some wasn't. An enormous step down in that department after Shang-Chi.

But I focused on all of the good, and tried to ignore the bad. It made for a much better experience, especially after moving past the initial disappointment of how truly amazing it could have been.I think the reason I found the protagonist so underwhelming is because she doesn't drive the plot. Her character is always reactive. Things happen to her. She's generally likeable, but a weak character. And one thing that was impossible to ignore even when I tried, Salma Hayek was a terrible choice.My favorite character is Druig, with a great performance by Barry Keoghan.

Halfway through, it's revealed their creators, the Celestials were planting seeds in the Earth as they must destroy planets to create a new Celestial.

{"review": "The question that is raised now is whether we have reached, and passed, peak Super Hero films. The reason I suggest this is because, well, after the conclusion of Phase 3 in Avengers End Game, it is difficult to see how they can exceed what they have already done. Also, with so many Superhero films being released throughout the year surely people are simply going to start to become sick of them. Like, okay, I'll probably continue to watch them, but when this film was realised, a part of me sort of wasn't really all that keen on going and seeing it, but did so namely because there was nothing else on. Okay, there was Shang-Chi, but the thing is that apparently we'll be watching that with friends.Anyway, the story goes that there is this group of immortals that have arrived on Earth to deal with these monsters known as Deviants that are basically killing off all the humans. For centuries they have lived alongside humanity, and even assisted them in developing, however at one point they simply drift into the background and left humanity work out their own things and will only appear if the deviants return. Mind you, as far as they are aware, all of the deviants have been killed, so they are sort of wondering why they are still around, that is until another, more powerful, deviant turns up. As a result, they decide that it is time to get the gang back together.Much of the film jumps between the present, and the past, where we are learning about the back story of many of the Eternals. We also learn that they have been sent to Earth by a group of powerful beings known as Celestials (who have made appearances previously in the MCU - with Ego the living planet being one in human form). Some people have commented that it feels that it is overtly long, but I didn't really feel that this was the case. I certainly didn't find it boring, though as with a lot of these films, there is a lot that they have to do to set up these new characters. Mind you, I'm not entirely sure how they are supposed to fit in with the Avengers, considering that they aren't supposed to directly interfere with human affairs (the reason why they didn't help with Thanos, which actually doesn't make any real sense when you learn who Thanos actually is).Yes, we do find a few more things out about Thanos in this film, despite the fact that he has been defeated. Then again, this is a cinematic universe, and the movies have been regularly building upon each other, something that certainly hasn't really been done previously. Yet, in the end, it does make me wonder how long they can keep this going, It also seems to be underperforming at the box office, and the critical reception hasn't been all that great either. Then again, I certainly wasn't all that enthusiastic in seeing this film, but in the end it wasn't too bad.One thing that I have noticed, and I do certainly praise Marvel for that, is that while they do have big name actors in their films, many of the leading roles tend to be lesser known talent. This is the case here since, despite Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie appearing in this film, the main characters were played by actors that, well, I haven't really heard off.

{"review": "\"Eternals\" is an Action - Drama movie in which we watch the start of a new saga of Marvel. The Eternals are a group of immortal beings living on Earth, helping people throughout its whole history and through all civilizations.I have to admit that I had high expectations from this movie since I have watched all the previous Marvel movies. A new era starts with this movie and we all have to be patient about it because time is needed for it to grow. Plenty of information came up and answered some of our questions regarding the Eternals and their purpose. \"Eternals\" surprised me since it was very different from what I expected but it was also interesting so, I am expecting the way that will continue it and what else it's going to present to us. The direction which was made by Chlo\u00e9 Zhao was good and she presented very well the main story behind Eternals but of course there is more information that needs to be presented. The interpretations of Gemma Chan who played as Sersi, Barry Keoghan who played as Druig, Lauren Ridloff who played as Makkari and Richard Madden who played as Icarus were very good. In conclusion, I have to say that \"Eternals\" is a nice movie as a start of a new era but we expect more from it in the future.", "helpfulness": 0.446064139941691}
{"review": "4 out of 5 stars.Eternals is beautifully stunning when it comes to a cinematic superhero film which director Chloe Zhao does well in capturing fantastic settings and scope. The film is way different comparing it to other marvel films. Zhao is aiming high for more of a compelling dramatic tension with the characters and great cinematography shots. And visual effects. The film does struggle with its pacing which can make it feel a little slow.What worked?The plot is great. The story gets bigger in the mcu. Showing Eternals which are immortal beings that have lived for 5000 years. Living among humans. While there agenda is protecting humans from deviants. There is more to the plot which gives it a twist about the Eternals hidden agenda. And a third act twist which a villain rises and divides and fights against the eternals. The idea of a celestial being born and needing to demolish worlds is an epic and thrilling direction.The cast ensemble is huge and all worked great with there characters. Gemma Chan did great as Sersei. Richard Madden is great. Along with Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie, and Kit Harrington. In the movie, the Eternals did a great job working as a team. Every character stood out. Jolie and Ridloff were awesome. Kit Harrington has a small brief role. There is a seed planted for a much bigger part for him in the mcu world.The cinematography, music score, production settings, and visual effects are all great and worth watching. It does feel like watching a big budget artsy film with a superhero theme. The film does have a long epic run time which gives it enough time for it to develop the characters. Lots of flash backs through the centuries. While they try to find each other on Earth. The film spends most of the time with Ikaris and Sersei trying to locate the other Eternals on Earth. So they can preparing for an upcoming doom.The action sequences were good. Chloe Zhao played it too safe and avoided overdoing it which makes the movie feeling a little quieter compared to other mcu movies. A few good action scenes. And a climatic fight trying to slow the villain down to save the world.What did not work?Eternals is slow moving with its pacing. It does have a pacing issue which sets up for an exciting adventure and a epic showdown. It gets slowed down with too many expositions with the characters that the script slows down.Overall, Eternals is epic, it is beautifully shot and done with a great cast ensemble, and a story that is taking mcu to a direction that has yet to be explored. Even with the slow pacing, it is still one enjoyable ride.There are two credit scenes, one mid credit which introduces a new character, and a post credit scene which hints for a characters fate for future movies.", "helpfulness": 0.45229681978798586}
{"review": "Oscar winning indie darling Chlo\u00e9 Zhao has had quite the directing career in the span of six years since her debut Songs My Brothers Taught Me first released in 2015, with the Chinese born filmmaker moving onto the critically acclaimed The Rider, the award sweeping Nomadland and now in one of the biggest career trajectory leaps I can recall in recent memory, the newest Marvel franchise starter Eternals.A comic book film that never really feels like a comic book film and one that doesn't pander too the typical Marvel formula that the company and its owners Disney have played too so successfully over the last decade, Eternals allows Zhao too bring her independent nuances to a narrative with a $200 million dollar plus budget, one that is full to the brim with ideas, characters and possibilities, that whilst not always adding up to a completely satisfactory whole, combine to ensure that Marvel's big risk can still be regarded as a success, flaws and all.A fairly well-known property amongst the Marvel comic community, Eternals isn't exactly a name brand entity in the wider film going landscape and Zhao has a lot of ground to cover across her two and half hour plus feature that at times struggles with the weight of various timelines, character movements and narrative devices, to ensure that audiences get up to speed with their Deviants, Celestials and all the ensemble of the Eternal gang but despite the film dragging through certain stretches of its running time and not always giving sufficient time to its cast (Angelina Jolie's troubled Thena and Lauren Ridloff's deaf Makkari springing to mind), Eternals is an often beautifully shot film and one that can be commended for trying to reach for the stars.As she's shown across her short but noteworthy career so far, Zhao is a great director of actors and knows how to explore her characters (often in Terrence Malick like visual storytelling) in ways that inspire thought provoking and heartfelt feelings, with rising star Gemma Chan doing well as the kindhearted Sersi, Richard Madden doing his best work outside of Game of Thrones as Ikaris and Barry Keoghan having a blast as the intriguing mind controller Druig, with all performers working well alongside Zhao to give Eternals something more than pretty visuals and big narrative moments, even if Harish Patel's scene-stealing chauffer Karun may be audiences real MVP.With so much going on and so many characters too juggle along the way, the film plays out in a way that isn't going to be as predictable and stereotypical of what Marvel has built in the years past, with those seeking endless barrages of action scenes and a big city destroying battle finale likely to be left feeling relatively empty by the way Eternals presses forward onto its endgame, changing up the pace in a neat way that while not placing Eternals up too be regarded as one of Marvel's finest moments, at least places it well and truly in the top-tier of their feature catalogue when it comes to offering up something slightly different and far more risky than what has come in the past.It nothing else, Eternals shows that Marvel are not content in allowing their tentpole pictures to become stale and worn out, a good thing for all at days end.Final Say -A big film that doesn't always manage to balance out its many moving parts and ideas, Eternals is nonetheless another entertaining piece of the Marvel puzzle that tries to give audiences something different from a brand that has become synonymous with comfort food blockbusters.3 1/2 Stark family reunions out of 5.", "helpfulness": 0.368}
{"review": "Eternals (2021) :\nMovie Review -Eternals, a part of Marvel's phase four, is a complete new chapter in MCEU's book. Although the film has references given about running in the same time as other Marvel flicks such as 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame', it has eternal backdrop right from 5000 BC. I wonder, if they were really here when Thanos caused mass destruction, why the hell they didn't show up? Oops, Let me go soft from here. Eternals is a whole new Superhero saga which brings you a bunch of unseen caracters and if you have been following Marvel Cinematic Universe since the beginning then this could be a new series to look out for. But wait, can you hold onto your patience for some time? I mean about 160 minutes with 3D glasses beginning to give you a headache? If yes, then go for it.MCU's recent projects have done great without theatrical release and notably, those came after 'Endgame'. 'Black Widow' and fresh fruit 'Shang Chi' earned back box office glory for them. I would have been happy to see them trying something nee after Endgan though. Something like what DC did with 'Joker'. Eternals does not depend on any such backdrop, it's a standalone product and maybe that's it will take some more time to create fan following. In the film, the Eternals, an immortal alien race, emerge from hiding after thousands of years to protect Earth from their evil counterparts, the Deviants. The screenplay here is not confusing at all but it is terribly slow. Marvel's Filmmaking may take a new turn from here as they have tried something calm this time, unlike super explosive narratives we saw in previous films. However, they couldn't try out something completely different from the trademark they carry which makes this film highly predictable.The story written by Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo is definitely not flawless but it isn't lame either. Creating a new universe for old fans might have put extra burden and that can be noticed in the film. It has those typical jokes carrying childish humour which you have left behind, 15 years ago. In 156 minutes, Externals hardly makes you seat through tightly but when it does, it does it fine. That slow pick-up to the main plot was expected because they had to introduce new characters without giving early spoilers. It slows down the vehicle anyway, almost to the level when you feel like having a little nap without taking those glasses off.Eternals stars an ensemble cast including Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Don Lee, Harish Patel, Kit Harington, Salma Hayek, and Angelina Jolie. However, the performances aren't that great. Some characters don't even make any sense considering the kind of powers they have. Somewhere, the writing is also responsible for that. Indian fans, please do not melt when you see Indian faces but please laugh when they crack hilarious one-liners. Visually, Eternals is splendid. The IMAX experience makes it truly wonderful and appealing. Marvel's VFX team has provided them a much needed boost here.No doubts, the whole thing is long. Sometimes it feels like, is it gonna take MCU's Phase Five to reach the End? That eternal longing certainly hurts the film but rest assured, it's a standard Marvel Film. Chlo\u00e9 Zhao puts all the elements demanded by Marvel Fans while she deliberately ignores unnecessary dramatic scenes. Was she driving towards daily-soap pulp? I think yes. This is 2021 and you are still using 2011 cliches to add some gags in the film? Seriously? I mean the film is made only for new kids or what? Let the fans decide that. They don't care much about content anyways because if they had, Marvel would have moved on from money-spinners to classic cinema long time ago. Nevertheless, Eternals is a grand visual treat which deserves to be watched only and only in 3D. Yes, Marvel Fans can flock into theatres to scream out for the new superheroes this Diwali while others can skip it for their own good.RATING - 5/10*", "helpfulness": 0.5295735900962861}
{"review": "It seems now that there's a real desire amongst some to be the first to declare Marvel's unprecedented run of hits as being over. For a while it's seemed like \"Eternals\" was the most likely to fail, given that there wasn't much in built adoration for the characters going in and whilst I'd accept that this is the \"worst\" film in the MCU, that's still pretty far from being an out and out disaster.Since time began, life in the universe has been seeded by the Celestials, a race of incomparably large creatures of unfathomable power. Once life on a planet has begun, it's defended from an ancient enemy, the Deviants, by The Eternals - a group of ageless humanoid aliens, whose powers are used to defend and shape the progress of the native life. After thousands of years hidden amongst us, the Eternals are called back into action when a Deviant, long thought to be defeated, arrives in London.This is, I think, going to be one of my reviews where I say that generally I thought something was OK, but then only list a series of things I didn't like about it. So to try and fill out the positives a bit, I do like the world building of this one and how to points us in the direction of some new characters for the MCU to utilise and where things might go for an Eternals sequel.Issue one is that it's too long, way too long, perhaps even as much as an hour too long. I never felt the running time in \"Endgame\" but I really did here, perhaps that's down to too many repeating story beats, or the plot not moving along fast enough, but either way this is the first time, with a Marvel film, I've felt that it's this length because they felt it ought to be, rather than because it actually needs to be.My second issue is also with the story, there's no audience proxy to get us into what's happening. Kit Harrington's character does it a little bit, but then he's sidelined - from there we're shown in multiple flashbacks about the history of the characters, and what's driven them to the point they are at now but it always feels like . . . Secondhand information, rather than something we're learning for ourselves. The best example I can give of this, without too hefty a spoiler, is that we're told that Sprite has always been in love with another character, but we're not (to my mind) shown any hints of that before we're told. There are also a lot of characters to be introduced to in this film and perhaps because of that some of the Eternals and the deviant leader, Kro, are underwritten.And finally, just whilst I'm on the subject of the Deviants, I didn't like them. I thought the CGI work was subpar and the character designs were uninspired. I think I'd have preferred something more akin to the comics, with an actual actor playing the role. Particularly when the character turns out to have little consequence to the overall story.As I say, generally I though the film was OK, with a second half much improved over the first. I think the future for the Eternals looks much brighter now this first film is out of the way, especially if they can get involved with a more intergalactic story, rather than an Earth based one. I'm sure I'll watch this again at some point, but for now it's just scratching an itch on the way to Spiderman.", "helpfulness": 0.3055555555555556}
{"review": "Eternals (2021) is a movie my wife and I caught in theatres its opening weekend. The movie tells the tale of Eternal beings sent to Earth to protect it from entities known as deviants. Once they rid the world of deviants they live relatively normal lives among the humans who are now able to flourish. However, when deviants return to the Earth's surface the Eternals will need to get back together to protect humanity and uncover why they've returned.This movie is directed by Chlo\u00e9 Zhao (Nomadland) and stars Gemma Chan (Crazy Rich Asian), Angelina Jolie (Tomb Raider), Salma Hayek (Dusk till Dawn), Richard Madden (Game of Thrones), Kit Harington (Game of Thrones), Kumail Nanjiani (Stuber), Brian Tyree Henry (Hotel Artemis), Barry Keoghan (The Green Knight) and Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd (IT).This was an extremely uneven movie. There are so many unique characters, elements and worthwhile conversations and topics. The CGI and action sequences are crisp and well done and the villain(s) are solid. There are also aspects of the storyline that dragged, characters that were painfully ripped off from the DC universe and decision made by key characters that make you slap your head and didn't feel realistic with the wisdom and perspectives of the Eternals.Overall this is worth watching and has some redeeming elements but is up there with Captain Marvel as one of the worst films from the Marvel universe in some time. This also did not need to be almost 2 hours and 30 minutes long. I would score this a 5/10.", "helpfulness": 0.5531914893617021}
{"review": "I am still waiting for that X-Men movie man.Not too familiar with the Eternals, which is why going into this I was thinking they were like mutants, the same way the Inhumans are like humans. With that said, like the Inhumans, the Eternals cannot beat what Charles Xavier and his misfit crew put together.The Eternals do try too hard to stand-alone. I am looking for a lot of references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I did not get enough for my taste at all. Realistically, this is why I go to the theatre to see these movies.As a standalone, movie it was not half bad. It had a fantasy like story with many cool characters played by good actors. I did like how complex a lot of the characters were. I felt that the Eternals moved away a lot from the superhero genre, nothing in the movie is as cut and dry as most of these Superhero movies are when it comes to the main characters being heroes.Because of this, once again a marvel movie is missing a good villain. They could have used one. As cool, as the characters are they did a lot of talking. Some of the characters like Kingo and Phastos were interesting enough to want to hear their story. I wish this held true for everyone, but it did not. Plus, all the talking made for too many moments where I forgot what the purpose of their mission is.I am impressed with the visuals, especially the Celestials (who keep changing with every movie they appear in, right?). They were impressively big seeing them on the big screen. I do not know if this was Chole Zhao's first rodeo when it comes to special effects but she definitely did not fall intio the same mistakes that the Russo brothers and Ryan Coolger mad on their first marvel movie outing.That is about it, however. It was not enough of a marvel movie to watch it on the big screen like the others with other people as into it as I am (cause no one else seem to be). I'm glad I saw it on the big screen cause the visuals were impressive but we are getting to the point in which I don't know who these marvel superheroes are and its changing my interest (Although in fairness I had no idea who the Guardians of the Galaxy where before seeing the movie and they won me over far better).", "helpfulness": 0.3359375}
{"review": "It's hard to discuss this movie and not get into the spoilers because the biggest moments of this movie necessitate ruining several of the big reveals. I loved that not everything was in the trailer and I successfully avoided reading too much about the film, which helped my enjoyment. This was the first movie I've seen in a theater since Halloween Kills, so the risk of COVID-19 and all its variants didn't keep me away* from the biggest movie of the year.This movie arrives as so many older directors gatekeep what constitutes a movie. So let me break down my opinion: movies can be anything you want them to be. There is equal room for a high end Oscar contender as there is for the junk low end world that I live in, the places where Godfrey Ho, Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei make their home.What else are comic book movies other than classical myths made with computers and no small amount of sound and fury? So yeah, this is the 27th Marvel Cinematic Universe movie and you know, you don't have to watch these movies. Hollywood -- the world -- is still making something for everyone. But for crowd-pleasing moments, the two biggest I've heard in years are when Captain America lifted Mjolnir and when one of the characters arrived in this film, a literally explosion of happiness and joy from an audience that has weathered so much in the last two years.And isn't that why movies exist? To make us feel something?No movie that I have seen in a theater in nearly a decade has elicited that emotional outburst and you know, it brought true joy to my heart. So I didn't feel silly expressing my emotions, whether they were happy when a certain legal professional made his presence known or the sadness of Dr. Strange's final words to Peter Parker.Spider-Man has always lived by the lesson that with great power comes great responsibility. He's a character informed -- in every incarnation -- by a great loss that he was at fault for and a lifetime of making up for that mistake.Yet Spider-Man: No Way Home presents us with something new. Great power with responsibility also means being better than your enemies and at times, working to make them better people and not just punching them into oblivion. The fact that antagonists can be worth saving spoke to me, someone usually given to mad revenge schemes and years of grudges. Even when doing the right thing ends up hurting you, you still can do the right thing.These are big concepts for a comic book spectacle. And this movie does what all great films should. It's stuck in my mind since I saw it and I wanted some time away from it before I wrote this. Spider-Man is the story of a bully grown up and moving past the way he was treated, often finding those bullies -- Flash Thompson, Eddie Brock -- become if not friends, certainly no longer enemies.This also gets into the Marvel idea of a multiverse, a connected web of other realities where small differences -- Disney+ set this up with What If...? And this idea will form the heart of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness -- but the main part of this story remains refreshingly human in the midst of big ideas, strange science and concepts like how magic works.Look -- I don't have to sell you on these movies. They make so much money that they're critic proof. But I do want you to consider that even if you hate superhero movies, even if you think there are too many of them, to consider your favorite film series. What if you had more than three of the original Star Wars films and they all were progressively better? What if the last Jason, Freddy or Hellraiser movie was so much better than the original? What if James Bond got more human, more relevant and more real as the world around him became even stranger?That's what's happening here. And it's amazing.*I'm triple vaxxed, beyond fastidious about mask wearing and personal space, and rarely if ever leave my movie basement. This isn't a political statement.

The references are plentiful without ending up obnoxious. They managed to find a way to give the large cast enough character moments and pathos that I wouldn't want a single one of them removed. The balance between drama and comedy is on point. No one just disappears into the background, and this doesn't take away the tragedy of them. The action is big, not excessively so.

{"review": "Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to Peter (Tom Holland): \"The problem is you trying to live two different lives. The longer you do it, the more dangerous it becomes!\"Notwithstanding the \"home\" in the title, the exciting new Spider-Man: No Way Home is more about the existential need to create one's own identity, the Christian need to give up a life in order to gain it, and the human need for a second chance. Many super-hero movies continue to emphasize the hero's need to recover a parent or child even more than the need to sacrifice for the good of humankind.As Peter Parker (Tom Holland) struggles with the attention he gets because Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) revealed his identity, he gets involved with Dr. Strange to erase his super-hero identity from everyone's memory. Fooling with Mother Nature never is good in these hyper-active fantasies, and it's true as Peter tries to get Dr. Strange to reverse his initial memory-erasing spell in order to remain in the minds of those he loves.Besides, what director Jon Watts and his writers are really interested in is pulling the three Spidies together (Holland, Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire) to remediate former bad boys like The Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church), Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), Electro (Jamie Foxx), and Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). Dr. Strange clears the way between parallel dimensions to let each Spidey's version of villains to come together for their cleansing.The imaginative and entertaining concept of getting these characters together proves not to be confusing but revealing of their generous natures and the benign fraternity of Spider-Men, adding the collaboration motif into their otherwise solitary lives.Although the digital gymnastics are impressive, beyond those is an attempt to flesh out character for both good and bad boys. Discoveries abound without super sentimentality or long exposition. Because the filmmakers have taken care to load meaning into most dialogue, the revealing third act takes the plot to dizzying heights while character spills out along the way.As more is found out about the heroes and the villains, the long road back to normalcy for Peter seems just about right, filled as it is with triumphs that come from working as a team (not a normal Spidey thing to do) to suffering the loss of dear ones to a better cause. It's a coming of age at any age and a satisfying display of character development that might be envied by indie films everywhere whose bread and butter is a similar attempt to show humans at their worst and best.Super holiday fare, yes; challenging, yes; amazed I am that comic-book stuff holds meaning amidst its visual splendor, yes.", "helpfulness": 0.7027027027027027}

{"review": "On paper, this film's premise should theoretically crash and burn. Past Spider-Man films have been criticised for stuffing in too many characters and plotlines. This film not only incorporates the main characters from all previous Spider-Man films, it continues their stories while keeping a tight focus on the main storyline. It is an incredibly rewarding experience for fans who are familiar with the whole Spider-Man franchise, yet it goes out of its way to be understandable to casual viewers who have not seen any other Spider-Man films. Truly, an impressive juggling act.The crux of this film is Tom Holland's Peter Parker struggling to have everything he wants, while the world tries to make him choose (as the Green Goblin succinctly puts it). His family life, friendships and career are all in jeopardy because of Mysterio's actions in the previous film. Unfortunately, in his youthful arrogance, he makes things even worse by trying to tamper with reality (not sure what Doctor Strange's excuse is).When the other villains enter from another universe, the results are magnificent. Advances in special effects have made them look exactly as they did years ago, but more dynamic and fluid. The writers have done a good job to make their personalities very consistent with the original films. In some ways, they even exceed their original portrayals. Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin definitely outdoes himself, filling the film with a truly terrifying menace who fights Spider-Man in a disturbing, brutal and violent way.The fanservice doesn't stop at the villains. The much-hyped return of Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire left the audience cheering and screaming, which is rare for New Zealand audiences (I've only seen that in two other films). I was grinning throughout the second half of the film because of the incredibly exciting and cathartic material from filmmakers who clearly understood the original films and what the fans want. All of this is beyond a mere gimmick - by learning from the villains and heroes of other universes, Tom Holland's Spider-Man understands the value of morality, giving people a chance, sacrificing one's personal comfort for the greater good, forgoing revenge and being careful with one's abilities. In other words, with great power comes great responsibility - a lesson often repeated but here demonstrated with the greatest stakes.That said, this film wasn't perfect.While it established the backstories and motivations of the villains quite well, it still remained vague in some places. Max Dillon seemed far more charismatic and power-hungry than his incarnation in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, where he was a mentally deranged loser out for revenge against those who didn't appreciate him. No doubt Jamie Foxx enjoyed playing this newer version of the character, but it seemed inconsistent. The hostile actions of The Lizard and Sandman were also baffling, as it's not clear what they want and they seem to change their minds without explanation.The soundtrack included some leitmotifs from the original films but these were too brief to have any impact. For example, Electro's brilliant theme lasts for about two seconds and then is never heard again.The scenes with three Spider-Men were often endearing and tied back to the original films. However, they dragged on for a bit too long and the emotion started to wear off in favour of humorous banter.Lastly, Dr. Strange's spell is a bit of an unexplained plot hole - Does it affect physical evidence like Mysterio's video and Flash's book? How can it do that? What exactly do people forget? If it affects everybody without exception, doesn't that mean that Peter Parker forgets about himself?It's an 8.5/10 from me.", "helpfulness": 1.0}
{"review": "5 out of 5 stars.Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic, big, and one of the best Spider Man films of all time. Literally nothing is holding this film back which the script contains about everything. And director Jon Watts making the best spider man movie ever. Fans and non fans are going to love the film. The story is best to go without any spoilers. There are many surprises that will leave the crowd cheering. Story also goes into an emotional direction and making the film feeling like a conclusion to the trilogy. Characters story arcs coming to an end. While opening up more possibilities to where the direction can go.No Way Home does the third film of concluding the story right unlike Amazing Spider man movie or the original third film where they cram up so many villains and a story that can barely hold it together. No Way Home script managed to balance the story and characters out. This film does have several villains. A lot of returning villains that is a lot of fun surprises and even with a new look. Peter Parker facing each one of them and trying to stop them is awesome. The plot is great. It can try to go in a emotional direction. There is also a fun brief appearance of another character which is cool to see and hoping to see more of them in future mcu films someday.The action sequences are awesome and stylistic. Spider man fight scenes are amazing. The visual effects are brilliant. The cinematography is well done in capturing the action scenes. The music score is different by Michael Giacchino but great. The cast ensemble did a great job. Like I said earlier, the appearances making a return is a lot of fun. For a long run time, the film does feel short and very fast moving which keeps your eyes glued to the screen.The climax battle is epic and exciting. Spider Man facing multiple villains is one of the best action scenes ever. It can be a bit dark. The action scene with Spider Man and Doctor Strange chasing each other through the mirror dimension is stunning.Overall, No Way Home is one of the best Marvel films ever. And one of the best Spider man movies. It is big, epic, and the script and direction had a lot of surprises. I am hoping to see Jon Watts take on another Marvel project.There is a fun mid credit scene that hints for where the direction can go. And a post credit scene that hints of where mcu is going next.", "helpfulness": 0.7169811320754716}
{"review": "THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW!There's not much chance of devoted Spidey/Marvel fans walking away from Jon Watt's and Tom Holland's latest web-slinging adventure without a strong sense of satisfaction from an epic outing, that in many ways feels as grand and risky as when the world first wondered how Marvel would manage to bring The Avengers to life all the way back in 2012.The third trip between director Watt's and his leading man, that sees the groundwork laid before it combine here in a loaded and fan servicing collaboration, to talk about No Way Home without giving away its many narrative treasures and likely iconic pop culture moments is a difficult task but there's reason to believe even early on in its release that this Spider-Man outing will go down as one of, if not the best big screen solo outings for the local neighborhood vigilante yet.As is always the case with such loaded Marvel outings, there are a few narrative conveniences that don't hold up to much examination and a few half-explored ideas but too dwell on these moments would be a waste of ones time when there's so much joy, fun and even unexcepted emotion to be found in Watt's film as Parker and his offsiders find themselves battling a severe multiverse problem that threatens to derail the world as we know it.Filled with an abundance of action set pieces, well-known Marvel comedic beats, more throwbacks and nods to lore than almost any other Marvel film before it and fun character interactions, what is perhaps most surprising of all about this high reaching adventure is the wealth of strong performances found within it from one of the most stacked casts the long running superhero brand has seen yet.From the expected and unexpected cast additions, everyone here brings their A-game with Holland and Zendaya as the loving couple getting great moments together and feeling well and truly like they've both become their respective characters in body and soul, while other returning cast members from both recent and less recent times all appear to care more than just a paycheck collection would suggest giving No Way Home a strong sense of purpose and heart, with the small moments making more of an impact than the films various action oriented segments.Likely to be a film that is explored multiple times and one that is sure to provide hidden moments of joy and satisfaction to those that delve back into it across the ensuing years, No Way Home is another groundbreaking achievement from Marvel who could've easily sat back and enjoyed their success after the events of Endgame but have continued to push the boundaries of blockbuster movie making as they keep looking to provide us with top notch entertainment that is undeniable and unmatched in quality.Final Say -There's no doubt about the fact that Spider-Man: No Way Home is the biggest and arguably best Spider-Man outing yet. A stunning achievement in pushing forward while also acknowledging the past, things here might not be perfect but there's too much to like here to deny that Marvel has once more raised the bar for the comic book cinematic landscape.4 imprisoned trees out of 5Check out my film blog Jordan and Eddie for more reviews!", "helpfulness": 0.7068965517241379}
{"review": "Spider-Man : No Way Home (2021) -\nMovie Review :The first trilogy of Spider-Man, directed by Sam Raimi, has a special place in everyone's heart. Tobey Maguire's Spidey became a memory, nostalgia for the kids who are adults now. After that so-so, decent Amazing Spider-Man, Marvel Studios brought this popular character in Avengers' Universe with Captain America: Civil War (2014) and MCEU fans went crazy. The Superhero got his own films Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man (2019), which made Tom Holland a household name. These films had that heroic touch of Iron Man (perhaps the most popular Avenger for the Fans), and now we have No Way Home as a whole new crazy Universe post Endgame. If you love Spider-Man movies, if you love Marvel movies, if you love Doctor Strange and if you love all those villains you saw in Spidey films over the years, then you are gonna enjoy this film like a festival. One hell of cobweb it is, and the Superlative Spidey smashes it in style. But, he is not alone. This is Holland's first Spider-Man film where Tony Stark does not appeared, but still he is not alone. Jon Watts, Marvel and Sony have delivered us a Gigantic Blockbuster Spider-Man Saga as a Christmas Present in advance.Spider-Man: No Way Home trailer was full of story, yet it has a lot of surprises stored for the final product. In the end credit scene of Far From Home we saw Parker being exposed, and now in No Way Home he wants people to forget that. He asks Dr. Stephen Strange makes his identity as Spider-Man a secret again with magic but an overload of time dimensions breaks open the multiverse and allows five supervillains from alternate realities to enter Parker's universe. Parker has to battle out the mess he has created and what more surprises he has to offer, must be kept secret by me. Yes, no spoilers at all. They are busy trending #DontSpoilNoWayHome on Twitter and I respect that. Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers' writing keeps you extremely busy during the watch, while the screenplay has no dull moments whatsoever. Just one condition, you don't have to look for the logic because you're watching a Marvel/Sony's Superhero film, not Christopher Nolan's Cinema.Sony and Marvel Entertainment have made a fantastic film like Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse (animation), which may remain unbeatable for years. No Way Home is like a Feature Film version of that intelligently nutty film. If I have to pick the best Feature Film (Superhero) recently, then No Way Home certainly tops the list. Jon Watts brings the madness of multiverse and passion of Spider-Verse together in MCU's Spider-Man No Way Home. A combination that will leave fans screaming out for the repeat watch. No Way Home is packed with solid action, fantastic story, lots of surprises; plenty of Heroic stuff, large size explosions, king-size entertainment and last but not the least, touching emotions. It saves a lot of cliches from becoming cliches. The climax will break the hearts of many Spidey fans but that's where the cinematic magic lies. You need an USP factor beyond that regular commercial potboiler, that's what it is. No Way Home will unite Avengers Fans and old Spidey Fans, and this Union is gonna explode at the box office. As a whole, Spider-Man: No Way Home is a smashing Blockbuster. MCU's most exhilarating entertainer post Endgame phenomena and believe it or not, it has the same amount of fans-crazy hysteria. Just go on hooting, no matter how much the ticket costs because the show worths it.RATING - 7/10*", "helpfulness": 0.5110410094637224}
{"review": "Reminded me of Avengers: Age of Ultron. Marvel comics is use to turning personal stories into epic events but for me that's strange for the movies.It does work better for the design of these Spider-Man movies, simple because spider-man is perfectly design for those personal stories. In this case it was one of the biggest crisis Peter Parker had to face when one of Spider-Man's biggest enemies J. Jonah Jameson (think about it) reveals to the world that he's spider-man. The event has Parker taking on personal issues that come with the reveal as Spider-man comes under criminal allocations (forcing him to need a lawyer (wink, wink), and his fame as the web swinging Avenger is divided, by those who love him and those who hate him. All this, not only messing up his life but the lives of those closet to him so he does a Marvel team up with Dr. Strange to change all that.The results of this team up turn No Way Home into the ultimate Fan film bringing together everything we loved about Spider-Man in Cinema for the last twenty years. In this plot No Way Home was spectacular. They paid homage to everything good about all the Spider-Man movies and poked fun of everything bad about the Spider-Man movies. We got to relive some things in spider-man movies that were not all that good made so much better in this film and things that were sensational in some of the movies were made even more sensational for this movie. Would love to be more detailed about what I'm talking about, but there is far too much story to spoil so I don't think I can.I'll say that No Way Home is an evolution for Spider-Man. We literally get so much Spider-Man, noting that next year will be the characters 60th birthday and it feels like we are getting that anniversary special a year (or few mouths) early. The best part is that as much as I love Tom Holland's Spider-Man he finally becomes the Spider-Man comic fans have known for the past 60 years in this movie.The action was exciting, the level of drama was top level. It could have made me laugh more but I loved the fact that they were more concern with showcasing the true type of hero Spider-Man is. I wonder if that has something to do with the fact that even though this film takes place in the Marvel Cinematic universe, it's obviously from opening credits to end credits not a Disney movie?Excellent, comic book movie!", "helpfulness": 0.59375}

The first 2 installments were Homecoming & Far From Home. Zendaya returns as his girlfriend, MJ & Jacob is his best bud. This one starts just as Far From Home ended, with Mysterio revealing Tom's identity to the world. Tom gets the idea to talk to Benedict/Dr Strange about helping him with his problem. Benedict decides to try a spell that would make everyone forget Tom's alter ego but things go wrong-of course-and a doorway to multiple dimensions is opened with some unannounced visitors popping up. You have villains and heroes from different multiverses to contend with-no spoilers here on who they are-and if you are a comic fan like I am, you will not be disappointed. It has lots of humor along with the usual fisticuffs too.

One of the few things I noticed while watching this film is how intimate it was with the audience. More than ever we begin to see things from Peter's point of view, and it sculpts a very touching and emotional narrative that is easily the best execution in a Marvel property in a while. While there are some small things I think they could have touched up a bit better, this film was massively entertaining, incredibly funny, and surprisingly very emotional in the best way possible. It blends the past characters so well into its story you hardly feel it's their first time in the universe. Even more, it's such a unique experience to finally see 3 generations of superhero fans unite for such an epic opportunity- of which seems more than well done- almost too good to be true at times.

Starts off fun, safe and familiar and then becomes extremely emotional, satisfying and full of great callbacks.

Zendaya and Jacob Batalon both have perfect chemistry with Holland and are also incredible in their own ways.Benedict Cumberbatch reaffirms why he's such a good Doctor Strange with his excellent dry wit and gravitas. All the returning villains give strong performances but Willem Dafoe is definitely the standout performance with an unsettling and terrifying presence.Jon Watts' direction is superb, the action sequences are thrillingly acrobatic once again, there's a few homages to the styles of the previous iterations and some gorgeous images. It's also perfectly paced with none of its roughly 2hr 30 minute runtime feeling dull or overly long.The CG is extremely impressive with next to no weak spots.

{"review": "LIKES:The Special Effects:\nDisney's resources can be used to craft amazing pieces, and No Way Home shows just how much of the good stuff they have when they put their time and money to it. Spiderman's dive into the multiverse is beautiful on almost all fronts in both design and animation. Dazzling displays of light, color, flashing, and explosions are blended together to make exciting, comic book feeling moments, all while getting hit with darker layers as the fight progresses. Spiderman facing the various villains seen in the trailer are fantastic, as web slinging, dodging, and various blasting occurs to rock the screen with amazing, theater rumbling effects. It's a very cinema worthy movie for this alone, but there is so much more to it.The Comedy:\nDisney is all about cramming the jokes into the movie to lighten things up, and sometimes they take it too far. Fortunately, No Way Home manages to keep the comedy in check, timing things at the opportune moments and hitting running gags to keep us ingrained in the MCU Spiderverse. The banter was mostly kept in check, each of the characters styles blended well together with awesome chemistry, and even better it was not too much to trip up the emotional moments this movie has, which is a fantastic balance for this reviewer.The Action:\nFor the most part, the fights and chases in this movie feel very much like something from the Marvel comic universe. Taking that classic Spiderman taunting, while implementing strategy, agility, and use of environment, led to some decent moments that were suspenseful and interesting to see what damage would be caused. As the movie's tone changed, the nature of the fights changed too to keep pace, and by the end it was an amazing blend of comedic, action, and emotion to paint a near perfect finale for me.The Acting:\nAgain, Marvel casted well in this movie and opens up so many great chemistry networks between the characters that were in this movie. Holland is still a wonderful blend of Peter Parker and Spiderman, who has taken the character again to further heights and pulls the character through the ringer. This movie puts the main character into the ringer and Holland does things so well to really grab that emotion and pull at your heart strings. Zendaya's quality still shines through, and her rendition of M. J. still holds the same core foundation, but starts to further evolve and grow the seeds planted at the end of Far From Home. Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange is top notch as usual, he's fun, he's classy, and he really sets the stage for the future of the character in this bizarre multiverse being set up and is exciting to see this transition layering more onto the character. Jacob Betalon as Ned again rocks in the comedy moment, but also extends to some other moments that were again perfect for the story. Alfred Molena, reprises the role of Doc Oc super well, bringing the same narcissism intellect of the character, but diving back into the complexity of the character we had in the second movie. There are so many more to compliment, but I can't due to potential for spoilers, but rest assure that the chemistry between this cast is a mixture of quality.Handling the Characters Well:\nSpiderman: No Way Home had a lot of balls to juggle and for me, they did it quite well with the material they had to present. Extending the story from the end of the last movie, while mixing in Strange felt very natural, with adequate time spent listing out the problems and solutions the two \"Avengers\" had to find for the spell that went wrong. And once that door was opened, the complexity of the story required a lot more planning and direction. Watts and the team succeeded, managing to keep a lot of characters in the mix and making sure their inclusion was meaningful past the simple marketing for toys. Even the villains get some decent balance, again bringing their own interactions and plot components that for the most part were not forced or counteractive. It was a fantastic display of coordination and effort and given the potential disaster this could have been, I'm very much happy with the results.The Emotional Heart:\nThese movies and characters mean the world to the fans, and that means crossing into the heartstring pulling territory. No Way Home hits this several times, and I loved the moral testing components that they wrote in here for so many characters. Diving deeper into these characters, we got past the simple good-guy vs. Bad-guy motif and instead got something much bigger that again justified the inclusion of so many things. This is certainly one of the clutch moments of the MCU and I dare say it was something that sets so much up for the rest of the wave.DISLIKES:Pacing at the beginning:\nIt's all about the set up and making sure we are ready for everything to happen in the movie. As such, that was the part of the movie that I found to be a little drawn out and boring at times for me. I don't know if I was just tired, or I was hoping for a little more movement or suspense and it took about the first thirty minutes before the first fight really kicked in. Once that happened, the pacing issues were very minor at that point, only going a bit fast a few times in how some of the twists were brought in.The Computer work at times:\nAs much as I enjoyed the special effects and CGI, I can't say that it was flawless. No Way Home does have moments where the computer look reared its head and took shortcuts into the less realistic looking realm. The very artificial movements, the digital look to the skin, and a few other moments did drop into the lower resolution. Again, a minor flaw for me, but something I have seen in the past get fans upset.The Action at Times:\nThere are times where the fighting really started to ramp up, finding a great pace and stride that was gearing up for a great Spiderman brawl. However, the action would then trip and lose that momentum with an abrupt ending. There were great moments where they achieved all those incredible fighting sequences, but there were times I would have liked a little more coordination and magic that we had with other films, especially at the end with the way they were solving some problems. It feels like they were running out of time and some cuts were made to offset the full coordination, but again this is still a nitpick moment for picking on to find the answer.Some of the Bad Guys Needed A Little More:\nDoc Oc as I said earlier was a fantastic villain they did so much with and Green Goblin as well has the bite that feels like an extension of the classic character. However, the Lizard and Sandman (which have been seen in the trailers), felt a little more time was needed to further expand upon their characters more and give them the same bite they held long ago. I know the reasons they were brought in for the most part, but... there still could have been some more fun with them to help get a little more mojo and time with them would have been amazing.Predictable:\nI got most of the twists they were trying to surprise us with. Lots of foreshadowing handed you the keys to getting the big events that were going to happen and how they were going to help repair the mess they were looking. I can't say that the call of things being a surprise were really a surprise. However, this minor dislike still does not take away from the enjoyment of the movie for me.The VERDICT:\nSpiderman No Way Home achieved a lot of greatness for this reviewer and makes me feel a little more comfortable from what is coming out of Marvel in the future. It's a fun movie that has so much to it and really brings forth an amazing experience meant for viewing in the theater. It's exciting, it's got heart, it's got comedy, and it keeps many things in the air with a balanced manner that was certainly exceeding the expectations that I had going in. No Way Home shows the multiverse may be in good hands and if they can continue this art of balance of new ideas and foundations, then we are in good hands. Sure, there are some pacing issues at time, some simplified solution finding, and a few characters needing a little more time. However, overall, this film is in the top Spiderman movies and I strongly encourage you to see it in the theater if you can find the time.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0\nMovie Overall: 8.0-8.5.", "helpfulness": 0.7166666666666667}

{"review": "Greetings again from the darkness. In a cinematic oddity, this is my second SWAN SONG film to review this year. The first was a SXSW starring vehicle for Udo Kier, and now we have the first feature film from writer-director Benjamin Cleary, who won an Oscar for his 2015 short film STUTTERER. It's safe to say the two SWAN SONGS share no similarities other than their title. Cleary presents a sci-fi drama that applies moral and ethical questions to advanced medical science, and our inherent desire to protect loved ones.Oscar winner Mahershala Ali (MOONLIGHT, 2016) stars as Cameron, a graphic design artist recently diagnosed with a terminal illness. Rather than disclose this to his wife Poppy (Naomie Harris, MOONLIGHT) and young son Cory (Dax Rey), Cameron opts for an alternative course of action offered by Dr. Jo Scott (8 time Oscar nominee Glenn Close). It's an extreme and risky solution to a horrible situation, and Cameron's only motivation is to shield his family from the pain and grief his death would cause.Dr. Scott, working with Dalton (Adam Beach), a psychologist, has concocted not just a cloning process right down to a person's DNA, but also the transfer of memories and subconscious memory storage into said clone. The idea is that loved ones never realize they've lost a loved one. Is this morally justifiable? Is it ethical? Is this deceit the right thing to do even if it spares the pain of loss? As Cameron goes through the process (and meets the new him), we see much of his life in flashback form, and get a feel for the love in his marriage, as well as the struggles incurred. While at the center ... a stunning modern facility buried deep in the picturesque forest ... Cameron meets another 'client' played by Awkwafina (CRAZY RICH ASIANS, 2018), who steers him through the process and the (at times) stifling emotions.Mr. Ali and Ms. Harris are terrific in their scenes together, and it helps us understand why Cameron agrees to do this for her. Director Cleary never backs away from Cameron's conflicted thoughts - probably the same most would have - and we comprehend why he's tortured. However, the film never tackles some of the big picture questions and issues raised by such a proposal. The film is certain to spur plenty of thought and debate.

Notice that the 'people of color' actors here are playing roles that are not race-specific. This is definitely a step in the right direction when we are no longer typecasting someone like Awkwafina for only Asian-themed roles like in \"Crazy Rich Asians\" or Mahershala Ali in \"Green Book.\" And let's not forget the presence of Glenn Close, showing us that a mature woman can also be a pioneer in tech. Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, step aside please.Towards the end of the movie, some ambiguity begins to be thrown in which feels contrived. It is a lazy and rushed way to end the movie.

{"review": "I am very fond of the first iteration of JUMANJI, with Robin Williams giving a wonderful performance and the latest in CGI, which looks either quaintly charming or charmingly quaint a quarter of a century later. The remake a couple of years ago struck me as foolish before I saw it, but it turned into a highly amusing movie, with some favored performers. It made enough money that now it is a series. If they continue at this level, it will be a pleasant movie for me to see every couple of years.When we last saw Jumanji, it had been turned into a home video game, and the youngsters were vowing never to return. Well, by and large they do, because the last one turned into a surprise hit. They're a couple of years older, cracks have formed in their relationships, and for various reasons, two of them can't go in, because their avatars are taken by Danny Devito as Alex Wolff's grandfather, and Danny Glover as Devito's former business partner. They've been angry with each other for several years.It's a different adventure, and it makes as much sense as any video game. The avatars get swapped around, so the acting fun consists of watching the actors playing other actors in a FACE OFF sort of way. Dwayne Johnson does a pretty good Devito imitation, but Awkwafina does a better one.This is one movie that is not going to win any awards, but if you're not in the mood for deep-dish suffering nor for something biliously Christmas-like, this is a movie with good performers in roles and situations that will amuse you.", "helpfulness": 0.8421052631578947}

It was a hoot to see actors like Duane Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black assume different personas as they made their way through the challenges thrown at them on the way to acquiring the Falcon Jewel. They all did a pretty good job of impersonating the characters they turned into, and even though the two Danny's, DeVito and Glover, didn't have a lot of screen time, you could feel their presence throughout the picture because of their roles portrayed by the avatars. As a senior citizen though, my best take away from the story came at the very end when DeVito's character came to terms with his age and stated to his grandson, \"Getting old is a gift\".

{"review": "The original movie is a childhood favourite of mine, and the reboot movie (almost a sequel as well), Welcome to the Jungle, was actually good fun, and was one of the highest-grossing films of the year, so naturally the makers followed with a direct sequel, directed by Jake Kasdan (Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, Bad Teacher). Basically, three years after entering the video game Jumanji, Spencer Gilpin (Alex Wolff), Anthony \"Fridge\" Johnson (Ser'Darius Blain), Martha Kaply (Morgan Turner), and Bethany Walker (Madison Iseman) lead different lives, but plan to reunite in Brantford. Spencer has become depressed, since he and Martha are having complications in their relationship, and he feels he has no purpose. Spencer contemplates returning to Jumanji and spends his first night looking over the broken video-game system he held onto. The following day, his friends visit his home, meeting with Spencer's grandfather Eddie (Danny DeVito), who is recovering from hip surgery, and Eddie's former friend Milo Walker (Danny Glover), who is visiting for an unknown reason. The group search the house for Spencer and find the Jumanji game repaired in the basement. Realising Spencer returned to the game, his friends decide to follow him. The game malfunctions when starting up, sucking in only Fridge and Martha, along with Eddie and Milo. Inside the game, Martha finds herself as her avatar Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan), but Fridge has become Bethany's avatar Professor Professor Sheldon 'Shelly' Oberon (Jack Black), while Eddie is Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, also producing) and Milo is Franklin 'Mouse' Finbar (Kevin Hart). After instructing Eddie and Milo on the game's rules, the group encounter non-player character Nigel Billingsley (Rhys Darby), the game's guide, who reveals that Jumanji is suffering from a massive drought. To leave the game, the group must recover the \"Falcon's Heart\" - a magical necklace stolen by warlord Jurgen the Brutal (Rory McCann) - which can end the drought if brought before sunlight and uttering \"Jumanji\". The group are transported to a desert called the Dunes, and narrowly escape a flock of pursuing ostriches. Bethany meanwhile finds fellow Jumanji player Alex Vreeke (Colin Hanks) for help to enter the game and help her friends. Inside the game, the group find Spencer, who has become a new avatar, skilled thief Ming Fleetfoot (Awkwafina), who agrees to help them after blaming himself for their predicament. The group face new challenges and problems whilst escaping the Dunes and collect a needed in-game item called a Jumanji Berry. Whilst obtaining the fruit, Fridge and Martha discover a pool of green glowing water that allows them to exchange their avatars. On the journey, Eddie and Milo bicker, it is revealed their friendship ended when Milo sold a diner they owned behind Eddie's back, forcing him into retirement. The group next encounter a perilous series of broken hanging bridges, whilst being pursued by an aggressive troop of mandrills. They soon become reunited with Alex, as his avatar Jefferson 'Seaplane' McDonough (Nick Jonas), and Bethany, operating a new avatar called Cyclone - a black horse that can only be understood by Finbar. After leaving the Dunes, the party find a river with the same glowing green water, allowing Spencer, Bethany, and Fridge to become their original avatars, while Eddie and Milo end up as Ming and Cyclone respectively. Shortly after changing characters, Jurgen and his mercenaries capture the group and brings them to his fortress. Escaping captivity, Spencer and chases after Jurgen to his airship, while the others distract his men. Jurgen is too strong for Spencer, but then he realises he has a weakness, the Jumanji Berry, which incapacitates him and sends him plummeting to his death. Discovering Cyclone has retractable wings, Eddie and Milo work together to rescue Spencer and bring the recovered Falcon's Heart to the sun, calling out \"Jumanji\", ending the drought and completing the game. The necklace is given to Nigel for safekeeping, but the group are surprised when Milo wants to stay behind. Eddie learned that Milo was dying of cancer, hence why he wanted to make amends, they reconcile before Milo flies away. Upon returning to the real world, Spencer and his grandfather play video games together, while Eddie returns to his old diner and longs to work as a manager, with his grandson and his friends turning up to enjoy a meal together. But the game may not be over, as a Heater Repair Man (Lamorne Morris) is drawn to the video game system, and a flock of ostriches suddenly rush past the diner. Also starring John Ross Bowie as Cavendish, Massi Furlan as Switchblade, Marin Hinkle as Spencer's Mom, Bebe Neuwirth as Nora Shepherd and Dania Ramirez as Flame. As before, Johnson and Gillan kick butt, and Black and Hart provide the laughs, DeVito and Glover give the film some heart, and Awkwafina is a good new addition. It feels like almost exactly the same story as before though, there are not quite enough dangerous jungle creatures like the original, and it again relies more on the jokes, at least there are some reasonably exciting sequences with good special effects, not a bad action adventure comedy.

When 'Fridge', Martha and Bethany go to his house they find Eddie, his crotchety grandfather, along with his former business partner, Milo, but no sign of Spencer. They decide they must enter the game to find him. Things don't go as expected... Fridge and Martha end up in different game characters than before and Bethany is left behind... and rather bemused Eddie and Milo end up in the game. It isn't long before an NPC gives them their quest... they will have to face various challenges before they can leave the game; they also still need to find Spencer.Often sequels are a little disappointing but I found this to be as much fun as the original. The main actors are back playing four game avatars but thanks to a fun twist each is playing a different 'real world' person. There is almost non-stop action once they are in the game; this provides plenty of thrills and a similar number of laughs. The effects are impressive and the cast does a great job. Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Jack Black and Kevin Hart really impress as the four main avatars and Danny DeVito and Danny Glover are fun in the real world roles of Eddie and Milo. Awkwafina is a good addition as new avatar Ming Fleetfoot and Rory McCann is suitably menacing as villain Jurgen the Brutal.

{"review": "The first Jumanji film, Welcome To The Jungle, was a lot of fun thanks to an amusing script, lots of entertaining state-of-the-art CG adventure action, and a great cast that included Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black and Kevin Hart. However, in my opinion, the best thing about the film was lovely Karen Gillan as Jumanji game avatar Ruby Roundhouse, a babelicious, kick-ass red-head in a skimpy outfit.The 'abs'-olutely gorgeous Gillan is back for the sequel and hotter than ever, making this a no-brainer for me, but the film itself is an otherwise fairly forgettable retread of the last one, with the same group of friends returning to the game where they attempt to save Jumanji (again) by retrieving another stone (from a barbarian and his horde). This time the gang is joined by two new players, Spencer's grandfather Eddie (Danny DeVito) and fellow OAP Milo (Danny Glover), which leads to not-very-funny gags (repeated ad nauseum) about the elderly characters struggling to understand their situation.The script could have been written by a ten-year-old, such is the level of invention and the sophistication of the humour. The action is, once again, visually impressive (especially in 3D) but heavily reliant on CGI, lacking a sense of realism with little in the way of genuine excitement or thrills to be had. At no point do we feel that the characters are in any real peril, especially given that each of them have three lives to waste, which we all know will be more than enough for them to complete the task at hand.Given how much I enjoyed the first film, I'm surprised at just how average The Next Level is.

There is that right amount of humor mixed with adventure. The CGI's are well done, giving the movie an extra little thing that adds to the adventurous feeling when your watching Jumanji. The cast is like usual very good in Jumanji. Every character and actor adds something special to the plot. I'm normally not a fan at all of The Rock but in Jumanji Dwayne Johnson is actually funny to watch.

{"review": "\"Dune\" is a great book and it, along with its sequels, are compelling reading. However, they are NOT short nor light reading and to make a decent version of the first book, it's hard to imagine doing anything other than making a mini-series. This was one of several reasons why I hated the David Lynch version from 1984. It crammed so much stuff into such a short film that it often was confusing....and the director himself hated the film. Apparently, the studio took the movie away from him and hacked it to pieces...thus making it so confusing. Because of this, I was not interested in seeing this 2021 version....until I learned it was only part one and the second film would complete the first \"Dune\" book.So, from the outset, this film can't help but be better than the 1984 version. BUT, it manages to do something I didn't expect...it's actually TOO long...or so it felt due to the pacing and ridiculous number of big scenes were not much happens but you see a lot of eye candy...along with very moody music. In many ways, it reminded me of the first \"Star Trek\" movie...which was so long and tedious...and had too many scenes where you just see a ship flying through space! And, in \"Dune: Part One\" there are too many scenes like this and not enough emotion and dialog. In other words, it seems to need a more personal and human tough to make it a truly great film. Now I am not saying it's bad or to avoid it. But the film could have been tightened up a bit and paced better.Fortunately, if you have never read \"Dune\", this film is approachable and does follow the book closely.", "helpfulness": 0.40046838407494145}
{"review": "Denis Villeneuve directs this remake of the Frank Herbert classic sci-fi. It's the first part of two movies. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is the lead as Paul Atreides. The emperor has given his family the desert planet Arrakis where the most important spice is mined. It's a trap and everyone knows it.I've never read the book. I have seen the David Lynch version and the Sci Fi movies. I do miss some of the Lynchian weirdness. This version feels more Earth-bound without the weirdness. Arrakis has a lot more middle eastern influences. House Atreides is more Scottish. I do wish that they get rid of the damn bagpipes. One hopes that they would get rid of that noise in a few thousand years. As for Chalamet, he is the perfect prettiness for the role. He looks too pretty to be believed as a fighter which is exactly what every other character comments on about him. He has the ethereal look of an angelic hero in an ancient classical Greek story. I'm not sure if newbies could get lost in this labyrinthian world. It's not really that complicated. I think Villeneuve has made the right movie.

{"review": "\"Dune\" is a really new American movie from 2021 that just got released and I saw that people really liked it, so I got curious and decided to check it out myself. It is a pretty long movie at slightly under 2.5 hours and the director is Denis Villeneuve, perhaps one of the most influential filmmakers right now and maybe number one from Canada. He is also one of the writers and the writing staff also includes an Oscar winner. You can check out the names there yourself. I shall instead elaborate a little more on the cast. Villeneuve being in charge resulted in many big names becoming a part of this project. The lead actor here is Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, definitely a rising star, but I must say I am not the biggest fan of him really. This is a bit of a problem as he is basically in this movie from beginning to end, but luckily, the supporting cast includes more than a handful actors that I like quite a bit. These would be Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem. With Brolin and Bardem, it felt like a bit of a reunion from No Country for Old Men, especially during the one brief scene/moment in which they clash to some extent. And as we are already talking Coen Bros movies, Isaac's Inside Llewyn Davis deserves a mention as well for sure. So you will find a few actors in here who have worked with the maybe most famous filmmaking brothers duo in the past. Brolin is featured heavily in the first half of the film, but then vanishes completely. Isaac also has more screen time early on. Bardem has a brief scene when his character is introduced, but appears in the last 30 minutes again. I personally thought that he would not show up again with this film, but play a central role in the second movie. Yes, there is a sequel indeed. This already becomes clear when this film here starts as we see a \"part one\" or something and also the way this one ends makes it very obvious that this is not it.As for the rest of the cast, Rebecca Ferguson is almost lead as well, which was okay. Zendaya I am still not buying the hype and she is only really in it near the end. Momoa is on the good side, while Skarsgard and Bautista are on the enemy team. The latter is really making himself a career now if you take a look at everything he has been in, even if it is always supporting parts. His recognition value probably helps as well. Oh yeah, Charlotte Rampling also has a memorable scene in here. I will get to that/her later. Of course, people will immediately think of the David Lynch Dune movie from decades earlier. I will not talk about parallels or differences now with that one because I have not seen it. Let's just focus on this one here instead from a standalone perspective. There is enough to elaborate on anyway. I must still say that I struggle with seeing Chalamet as some kind of hero or chosen character. I don' think he has the props to really pull it off. Of course, this is the idea that he does not look like Hulk or Thor or something, but when I see him show his dedication like how he really wants to join Momoa's character or how he can defeat Brolin's character in a duel or how he leads his mother in the desert and knows exactly how his items and uniform work because he is such a natural or how he in the end says his path leads through the desert, it is difficult to believe. Also how he of course wins the battle against this fella near the end who challenges him. And he has to kill in the process, which also shows us how much of a kindred spirit he is that he has never killed somebody before.Death is a crucial component in here. Still I must say seeing how literally every single good guy, be it Isaac's character, be it Momoa's, be it the seer, goes out in a heroic manner that puts harm to the enemy side was a bit much and eventually also repetitive. There were other issues I struggled with here in terms of the plot. Take a look at the idea of Chalamet's character playing a real hero. Basically he is the future. And yet, his own folk (Rampling's character) were ready to kill him immediately with this poisonous needle if he pulls out his hand from this box that caused so much pain to him. Or his dreams and premonitions linked to Zendaya's character were also not exactly new or inspired the way they were put on display here. I could go on by saying that for example the introduction did feel too long and this movie could have been (or should have been) half an hour shorter perhaps. What I cannot say anything negative about is really the way in which the bad guys attack. When they come for Isaac's character and the others, it is really spectacular and this is when this film is at its very best and an incredibly tense thrill ride. In the middle of the film. Unfortunately, when this is over and the bad guys have won for the moment, it gets a bit weaker again and here and there it drags a bit and has some lengths. What also can be said is that this film is never really intended for comedic purpose. The way you could see it a lot on another Bautista fantasy/sci-fi movie. There was this one moment when Momoa's character talks about Chalamet's character's muscles that was a bit on the playful comedic site and maybe one or two other inclusions as the film went on, but yeah this is not a movie to pick for light relief or something. It takes itself very seriously. Does it have the right to? I am not sure.Of course, there is absolutely nothing wrong with sets, cinematography, costumes and all other visual/audible production fields, but this is pretty much a given now with a film of this dimension, even if we maybe should not see it as a given. With the likes of Zimmer, Roberts and West in charge, however, there is at least as much competence available in \"minor\" departments as there is in front of the camera. If not more. But back to the action itself: With the spectacular visuals, this is definitely a movie you'd rather want to check out at a theater than at home on a small screen. Unless you have a home theater of course. Oh yeah, another moment that will maybe make you smile is how Isaac's character tries to get Brolin's grumpy character to smile really early on. The latter reminds me a bit of the man Brolin played on Sicario. Anyway, I guess we will see more from Brolin's character in the sequel here as well. As for Villeneuve, I must say I liked his earlier stuff like Prisoners, but his recent take on Blade Runner did almost nothing for me unfortunately. Quality-wise, this movie here is somewhere in-between. It's not a revelation or anything and I think the reception is way too positive (I even saw people consider Chalamet for an Oscar nomination, like come on!), but it is worth seeing if you like the genre and some of the cast members I suppose. Not a must-see by any definition though. Seems as if Villeneuve really enjoys giving us his take on some films that are considered classics. It certainly could have turned out worse here, but I hope that with whatever he does in the future, also after this sequel here, he can manage to be a bit more essential again. The pathos felt a bit much at times and did not always ring true. This maybe also could have had to do with Chalamet for me though. If you like him more, you will maybe not see it.The attention to detail at times was still pretty good. I liked Brolin's words during the training sequence linked to Chalamet's character expressing he is not in the mood for fighting or so and how he has to fight when the time is right and how this felt connected to his battle with one character near the end. Completely aside from that, I initially struggled with the sand component, but in the second half they turned the background and location into something special and you could feel the endless desert element finally. Also the idea of these sandworms was depicted nicely. Or how a ring is used to print a seal or signature. Or these helicopters that look like insects. Or the little drone, so it is not just the big spectacular inclusions where you can see all the talent that was included in the making of this film. Unfortunately, there were also many struggles. I mentioned most of them, but while I already stated that the introduction felt too long, the real introduction at the very start felt incredibly rushed and it was impossible to remember all they mentioned there. Pretty much a no-go for a film with this running time. All in all, I still give it a thumbs-up and I think the good is more frequent than the weak, but there's no way I would say that this is among the very best films of the year 2021 so far. Maybe the better, but not the best and I hope that Villeneuve can step things up with the second film, but given the lead actor I kinda doubt it. Anyway, if you like this one, you can probably keep watching. Maybe said sequel is out already once you read this review of mine and then you can decide for yourself anyway.

{"review": "I just reviewed the 1984 movie - based on the same source/novel. As I wrote in that other review: I have not read that book. I did watch the \"original\" movie to have an idea what Villeneuve did. Denis Villeneuve is a director who I adore a lot. His weird and very strange movies that are like a punch in the gut and warrant multiple viewings to understand are one thing - but he has proven that he can also do blockbuster movies too.Like this one - there is not much left from the campy feeling of the first one. There may be some things still here that people may feel offended by. But in this day and age it's impossible to do something without sparking outrage and trigger at least one group or the other (whatever side of the spectrum they belong to).While the camp is gone, the movie is also much clearer. The original needed a monologue in the beginning and even that muddled things up rather than made them clearer. What both movies have in common is the cast in front of the camera is superb to say the least. While the original had issues with the costumes but even more so the special effects, this one thrives in both. Excellent work, from everyone included.I chose the summary line because this may very well be one of the best Science Fiction movies (larger scale that is) to date. No offense meant to any Lord of the Rings fans of course. Rather meant to be a compliment. Like the Rings movies this also is supposed to be a trilogy if I understood what was being said right. The thing I know is that we will get a sequel. When this hit cinemas, it was only called Dune. Now it is Dune Part one. And I am happy to say the least to come back and revisit this world. If possible on an Imax screen again of course.The scale of the movie is immense and while there was one annoying bag pipe moment (you know who you are!), the music/sound design and the cinematography worked hand in hand. I can only recommend this so much - if you are into Science Fiction movies I am quite certain you will like this too.

{"review": "It's been some time since I've read the Frank Herbert novel, and I had already forgotten much of the story. However it wasn't a problem picking things up as characters and situations presented themselves in this film, so I'd have to say that was a plus for this viewer. The scope of this picture is quite outstanding, spanning as it does a complex and fragmented universe of worlds and kingdoms. Central to the story is the valued importance placed on a spice that's a preferred hallucinogenic for some, and for the elite, an important component required for interstellar travel. In the novel I believe it was something as common as cinnamon, but on the planet Arrakis, required an intensive mining operation to reclaim it from the barren desert soil in which it's found.The entire story is veiled with a mystical sort of ambiance in which the protagonist, Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), learns of his destiny while obliquely being referred to as 'The One' of legend, a person who will come into great power. Quite honestly, the setting, costuming, characterizations and palace intrigue is all quite reminiscent of 'Star Wars', even if the original novel was written over a decade before George Lucas arrived on the scene. Even the hostile environment of Arrakis has the feel of Tatooine, with the appearance of the Shai-Hulud recalling the Sarlacc, one of Jabba the Hutt's favorite pets.What surprised me with this first installment of the Dune saga was how well director Denis Villeneuve managed to condense the epic scope of a massive novel onto film, even if half of the story is yet to be told. The movie incorporates the most critical elements of the novel into a narrative that works really well. Even though I actually did enjoy the 1984 version directed by David Lynch, this one proves to be more inclusive of events in the novel, and I look forward to a successful conclusion to the saga in due time.", "helpfulness": 0.5801713586291309}

{"review": "The 1984 David Lynch movie was a box office flop and has been garnered with mixed to negative reviews over the years, but the trailer for the new movie, based on the cult book by Frank Herbert, looked like it would be much better, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Arrival, Blade Runner 2049). Basically, in the distant future, the year, 10,191, in the known universe, Duke Leto of House Atreides (Oscar Isaac), ruler of the ocean planet Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV to replace House Harkonnen as fief rulers of Arrakis. The planet Arrakis is a barren desert planet populated by gigantic sandworms, better known as Dune. It is the universe's only source of the spice called melange, a drug that extends life and expands consciousness. The Spice is also critical for safe instantaneous interstellar travel to any distance in space. Shaddam intends to have House Harkonnen stage a coup to retake the planet with aid of the Emperor's Sardaukar troops, eradicating House Atreides, who threaten Shaddam's control. Leto is apprehensive but sees the political advantages of controlling the spice planet, and an alliance with its native population, skilled fighters known as the Fremen. Leto's concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) is part of the Bene Gesserit, an exclusively female order with advanced physical and mental abilities. Although Jessica was instructed by the Bene Gesserit to bear a daughter to descend and become the Kwisatz Haderach (\"one who can be many places at once\"), she instead gave birth to a son, Paul (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet). Throughout his life, Paul has been trained by Leto's aides, Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa), Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin) and the Mentat Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Henderson), while Jessica trains Paul in disciplines of the Bene Gesserit. Paul talks to Jessica and Duncan about troubling visions he has had of the future. Due to these visions, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) visits Caladan and subjects Paul to a deadly test. He is subjected to experience excruciating pain to his hand, to assess his impulse control, which he passes. Later, Mohiam instructs House patriarch Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) to not kill Paul and Jessica during his coup. He agrees not to harm them but intends to cause their deaths indirectly to end their bloodline. House Atreides arrives at Arrakeen, capital city and fortress stronghold on Arrakis, where Duncan and an advance party have been learning about the world and the Fremen. Leto negotiates with the Fremen's chieftain Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and meets planetologist and imperial judge Dr. Liet-Kynes (Sharon Duncan-Brewster). Kynes explains the dangers of spice harvesting to Leto, Paul, and Halleck, including the giant sandworms. During a flight, they spot a sandworm approaching an active spice harvester with a stranded crew. Leto and his team rescue the workers moments before the sandworm swallows it. Paul's exposure to spice-laden air triggers intense premonitions. Following an attempt by a Harkonnen agent to kill Paul, Leto's soldiers are put on high alert. Suk doctor Wellington Yueh (Chang Chen) disables Arrakeen's critical protective shields, allowing Harkonnen and Sardaukar troops to overwhelm the Atreides forces. Yueh incapacitates Leto and tells him he made a deal with the Baron to deliver him in exchange for freeing his captive wife. Yueh poisons Leto with a gas capsule and is killed after delivering the Duke. Leto releases the poison gas, killing himself and members of the Baron's court, but the Baron survives. Duncan escapes and steals an ornithopter (an aircraft with rapidly flapping wings). Harkonnens capture Paul and Jessica and intend to drop them in the desert to perish. Paul and Jessica overpower and kill their captors using a Bene Gesserit power called \"The Voice\" to control others verbally. Finding a survival kit left for them by Yueh, Paul and Jessica spend the night in a tent. Paul experiences visions of a \"holy war\" spreading across the universe and him leading it. The Baron hands over command of Arrakis to his brutish nephew Rabban aka \"Beast\" (Dave Bautista) and orders him to sell spice reserves and restart production to recover the cost of the coup. Paul and Jessica are found by Duncan and Kynes and head to an old research station but are soon tracked down by Sardaukar. Jessica, Paul and Kynes are allowed to escape the facility when Duncan and various Fremen sacrifice themselves. Kynes, ambushed by Sardaukar troops, lures a sandworm that devours them along with her. Paul and Jessica reach the deep desert and meet the Fremen, among them are Stilgar and young warrior Chani (Zendaya), who Paul has seen in his visions. Their admission into the tribe is protested by Fremen warrior Jamis (Babs Olusanmokun), so they have a ritual duel to the death, and Paul is victorious. Against Jessica's wishes, Paul states they will remain on Arrakis with the Fremen to reclaim the planet. Also starring David Dastmalchian as Piter de Vries, Benjamin Cl\u00e9mentine as Herald of the Change, Golda Rosheuvel as Shadout Mapes, and Roger Yuan as Lieutenant Lanville. I'm not going to pretend I understood everything going on, with all the stuff involving religion and politics, just the main plot that everyone wants the spice. Chalamet makes for a good young hero, Skarsg\u00e5rd is good at being the nasty and grotesque villain, and the all-star cast, including Isaac, Brolin, Rampling, Zendaya, and Bardem all get their moments as well. The visuals and special effects are fantastic, from the spaceships and alien creatures to the interior and exterior locations and large-scale battle scenes, so it doesn't matter if you don't understand it all, it is a great spectacle, and hopefully the second part will be as exciting, a worthwhile epic science-fiction adventure.

{"review": "Sure, I was looking forward to getting to watch director Denis Villeneuve's take on Frank Herbert's iconic story \"Dune\". And yeah, I did also enjoy the 1984 version of the tale, so of course this 2021 version was something that had to be watched.And yes, I did enjoy the 2021 rendering of \"Dune\", of course I did. I mean, how could I not? Despite of running for a bit more than two and a half hours, the movie was entertaining and enjoyable. And this was just the first part of the story, so we are in for more.Visually then \"Dune\" was just spectacular, having pretty amazing special effects that brought the world of Arrakis to life on the screen. And if you enjoy CGI effects and great special effects, then \"Dune\" doesn't disappoint.In terms of casted performers, then the majority of the cast were actually nicely cast for the various roles and characters. Now, I am not familiar with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (playing Paul Atreides), but he was no Kyle MacLachlan (playing the same character in the 1984 movie). This 2021 version of \"Dune\" also have the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd on the cast list. I was really impressed with Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd in the movie.And while \"Dune\" is watchable and entertaining, I must admit that I was left with a sense of 'was this really a necessary remake?' once the movie ended. And then my thoughts went on to \"will it be remade again in 40 years, with whatever technology is available then?'. So there was that whole whether this remake was a necessary thing or not looming over it.And I also feel that the character gallery was a bit underdeveloped, as I felt most of the characters were only given superficial characteristics and personalities, never letting the audience really get to know the characters backgrounds, motivations and such. It just felt a bit too shallow in terms of character development and growth.If you have the chance to watch \"Dune\", then do so. By all means do so, because it is an entertaining movie.My rating of \"Dune\" lands on a six out of ten stars, like the 1984 movie. Sure, this 2021 movie was more pleasing to look at, but of course almost 40 years have done lots to the development of CGI in the movie business. But the 2021 version is held back by an inferior character gallery and that overwhelming sense of this being essentially just a massive waste of money and effort in terms of remaking something that didn't really need to be remade.", "helpfulness": 0.2926078028747433}

{"review": "Fans of \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) might recognise the bleak scenery around Wadi Rum, one of many stunningly beautiful and evocative locations used is this epic piece of cinema. It is that photography, and another hugely complimentary score from Hans Zimmer, that perfectly sets the template for this adaptation of Frank Herbert's story of family, avarice and power. I was sceptical about it being split into two parts (especially given the lengthy delay between this and the sequel) but it really works well. The unseen Emperor of the Known Universe commands that house \"Atreides\" take over the mining of the valuable \"spice\" from their arch enemy the \"Harkonnen\", and so the Duke (Oscar Isaac), his wife \"Jessica\" (Rebecca Ferguson) and son \"Paul\" (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) must prepare to relocate to their new and distinctly hostile desert world. It is clear from the outset that young man is troubled. He sleeps fitfully with strange dreams all set upon a planet he has studied but never visited. Upon arrival, they are betrayed and the young man and his mother must find and befriend the local \"Fremen\" population and learn how to survive and to fight back. Now I won't fib, it does drag a bit at times, and if you already know the story from either the book, or the David Lynch version from 1984, then that can lead to you wanting to shout \"get on with it\" at the big screen, but being patient with this brings it's own rewards. The attention to the detail, and the grand scale of this feature is immersive, it draws you in and there is enough action, and food-for-thought to sustain that interest for the most part. Chalamet offers us a strong and engaging performance. He is growing as an actor, maturing - and though he still looks like a decent meal would kill him, he owns the picture in a way (for me, anyway) that he never has before. The remaining cast members gel well together, and the mysticism and political manoeuvring that underpins this story is subtle and nuanced but potent in it's presentation. The costumes and visual effects are splendid - I want one of the locust-copters (though heaven only knows what the vibrations must be like onboard!), and we do get a sense - but really only that - of the enormity of the giant worms that patrol the desert looking for their quarry. The second part of the novel was always the more interesting. We will see the characters develop more, and we will learn more of the troubled \"Paul\" and of whom he really is - as well as there being much more actually going on. If this is the standard of the opening gambit, then what is to come ought to be wonderful.", "helpfulness": 0.3669064748201439}
{"review": "Watching director Denis Villeneuve's groundbreaking adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel \"Dune\" is like feasting on an all-you-can-eat buffet. You can gorge yourself on combatants and conspiracies galore during its spartan 156-minute runtime. Unlike its ill-fated predecessor, David Lynch's critically reviled \"Dune\" (1984), which shoehorned Herbert's gargantuan magnum opus into a procrustean 136-minute escapade, Villeneuve has the good sense not to pile everything into one film. Instead, this $165 million reboot delivers only half of the chronicle, while we must bide our time until the sequel. Some sci-fi fans may cringe at this prospect, but Warner Brothers refused to bank roll the sequel before \"Dune\" generated some box office traction. Mind you, sitting for two-hours and thirty-six minutes requires not only purpose but also patience. Meantime, Villeneuve retreads several Lynch scenes, but does it with greater scope and spontaneity. You cannot help but be caught up by the rollercoaster blend of white-knuckled cliffhanger heroics and Byzantine political intrigue. Although classified as science fiction, \"Dune\" never degenerates into a juvenile \"Buck Rogers\" space opera. \"Star Wars: Rogue One\" lenser Greg Fraser depicts these larger-than-life characters against surreal landscapes in sprawling picturesque murals. Surrounding Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who toplines as the hero, is a formidable cast consisting of Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista, and Stellan Skarsgard. Overall, \"Dune\" raises the standards for sci-fi blockbusters. Nevertheless, the filmmakers don't bewilder the audience with narrative overload. Clearly, Villeneuve has surpassed his earlier outing \"Blade Runner 2049\" (2017), and one can only wish him greater success with this sequel.Imagine a mash-up of \"Star Wars\" and \"Game of Thrones,\" and you'll have a clue about what ensues. Specifically, \"Dune\" takes place in the year 10,191. This tour de force saga of clashing empires unfolds on the bleak desert planet of Arrakis. This savage, sun-scorched world is the only source in the universe for a unique mineral called spice. Not only does interstellar space travel hinge on spice, but it also is a psychedelic drug that heightens awareness and lengthens life. The evil Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd of \"Good Will Hunting\") of the House of Harkonnen, who amounts to a smaller version of Jabba the Hutt, has reaped an obscene fortune in spice from Arrakis over the last 80 years. Now, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV removes the Baron and replaces him with a rival, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac of \"Ex-Machina\") of the mighty House of Atreides, who hails from the ocean planet of Caladan. Accompanied by his consort Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson of \"Doctor Sleep\") and their teenage son, Paul (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet of \"Lady Bird\"), the Duke arrives on Arrakis with his aide, Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin of \"Sicario\"), and a vast army. Leto suspects the corrupt Emperor may be setting him up for failure.Pandemonium erupts soon after Leto has taken over the spice mining operation. Earlier, the Duke had vowed to forge an alliance with the natives. Known as the Fremen, this disgruntled nomadic race resides in Arrakis's deep caverns and conducts campaigns like guerrilla warriors against the spice miners. Suffering dreadfully under the Baron, the Fremen expect similar treatment from Leto. The Duke dispatches a scout, Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa of \"Aquaman\"), to embed himself among them and win their hearts and minds. Swathed in hooded white cloaks, this mahogany-skinned tribe has dazzling cobalt blue eyes from using spice. A blue-eyed babe haunts Paul's dreams. Meantime, the mining equipment Leto inherited from the Baron is in rough shape. If the broiling temps on the surface weren't bad enough, prodigious sandworms--some as long as 13-hundred feet--cruise beneath the shifting sands like great white sharks. These leviathans can wrap their elastic mouths, bristling with zillions of wicked, razor-sharp fangs, around an entire spice harvesting machine. Eventually, treachery within Leto's palace topples his rule, and the Baron's soldiers annihilate Atreides' army. Miraculously managing to escape, young Paul takes refuge with the Fremen and ponders a rebellion against the Baron.Comparisons between \"Dune\" and \"Star Wars\" are inevitable. Indeed, both films share certain formulaic scenes which seem virtually interchangeable. An empire-building yarn with anti-colonial sentiments, \"Dune\" takes itself far more seriously than \"Star Wars.\" When Paul watches his mentor perish, our hero suffers as tragically as Luke when he witnessed the demise of Obi-wan Kenobi. \"Dune\" differs, too, because it is a sword and sandal saga about supernatural critters. Arrakis makes Tatooine seem like a beach resort. Villeneuve and \"Prometheus\" writer Jon Spaihts and \"A Star Is Born\" scripter Eric Roth don't overwhelm the audience with volumes of exposition that cluttered up the Lynch film. Instead, they parcel out exposition and use it to foreshadow events. The warfare is conducted with ancient as well as futuristic weapons, with emphasis on ancient weapons. The dragonfly helicopters-known as ornithopters-look exciting. The crisp dialogue is both pointed and compelling. Villeneuve and company never cut our underdog heroes any slack in this initial bloodthirsty chapter, and the evil Baron maintains the upper hand despite minor setbacks like a near-death experience. As villains go, the grotesquely fat Baron makes an admirable but unscrupulous adversary. Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa wield their weapons like old hands. Unlike Lynch, Villeneuve doesn't rub our noses in unsavory violence. Nonetheless, the battles are savage without being sadistic. Hans Zimmer's brawling orchestral score with native choral interludes enhances the atmosphere. Altogether, \"Dune\" qualifies as the first truly great science fiction classic of the 21st century with a coming-of-age hero driven by prophetic dreams he cannot fathom.", "helpfulness": 0.5643564356435643}
{"review": "At the very end of \"Dune,\" Denis Villeneuve's attempt to make a screen version of the novel that isn't a disaster, a character says, \"This is only the beginning.\" The line is meant to be an enticing promise of what's yet to come. To me it sounded like a threat. I knew this was only the first of a two-part movie, and yet this bit of news still managed to be one of the most demoralizing things I've heard in a long time.The creators of \"Dune\" clearly love the source material and have attempted to make something true to it with much care and love. But they've somehow still managed to make a lifeless, dramatically inert bungle of it. I didn't feel a single thing during this nearly three-hour movie, except the urge to pee, which I knew would happen given the size of the Modelo I bought at the concession. Seriously, you should have seen this Modelo. I paid $13 dollars for it, which was almost as much as the amount I paid for the movie ticket and parking combined. At first I was astounded, but then I saw the can they were handing to me. It was like I got my own personal keg of beer. This is the first time I've ever had a movie end and realize that I still had beer to drink, which I chugged during the closing credits.Wait...did I wander away from the subject of \"Dune?\" That's because the story of my beer is more interesting than this movie. Have you ever seen the musical \"Urinetown?\" If you have, you know that there's a song at the beginning about how the characters don't want to overload the audience with too much exposition right off the bat. The creators of \"Dune\" should have watched \"Urinetown.\" This movie is nothing but exposition. We have to have someone explaining something to us in every scene. At one point, there's even a five minute scene where one character literally tells the other characters how their suits work. It's like a mechanic explaining to you how a car engine works when you're not that into cars. There's an audience for it, but I'm not it.One brown, ponderous scene follows another, while Hans Zimmer's screeching score drones on and on. At first it was just there, but by the end of the movie the music had me wanting to climb the walls. It becomes a parody of itself. By the time a bunch of female vocalists came on the soundtrack wailing in something resembling a Middle Eastern way, I had decided that this might be one of the worst scores Zimmer has ever composed.The movie never changes tone. I mean never. It never changes pace. I mean never. I suppose during some action scenes the editing literally gets faster, but the scenes still somehow manage to remain lifeless and unexciting. I never felt a sense of adventure, which is odd for a movie about a young man who gets the opportunity to leave his home planet and experience something new. I never cared about anything. None of the actors seem to be having any fun being in this movie. Timothee Chalamet is pretty as a postcard, but he has exactly one facial expression. Oscar Isaac is in this. So is Jason Mamoa. So is Josh Brolin. So is Javier Bardem. Lots of good talent. All of it swamped by colorless production design.This is the kind of movie with rabid fans who will tell you that there's something wrong with you for not liking it. I can just hear them saying things like \"Stick to 'The Fast and the Furious' you nincompoops who are too stupid to understand such profound things as 'Dune',\" as if they have any idea who I am or what my movie tastes are. Let those people get their knickers in a twist, and let those who also thought this movie was a boring slog join me for a keg-sized Modelo. Cheers!Grade: C-", "helpfulness": 0.564453125}
{"review": "Spice, a substance mined only from the deserts of planet Arrakis, is the most valuable commodity in the galaxies since it enables interstellar transport. The violent and sadistic Harkonnen family have help the spice mining franchise for 40 years, becoming immensely wealthy in the process, alienating Arrakis natives the Fremen in the process. The Emperor abruptly appoints the Atreides family instead, infuriating the Harkonnens who sabotage equipment left behind, and plan a violent takeback. This results in heir apparent Paul Atreides and mother Jessica being abandoned in the desert, where they need to fall in with desert experts the Fremen in order to survive. Trouble is, after 40 years of the Harkonnens, the Fremen aren't very keen on offworlders.And.... end of part one. We are halfway through the story, with a part two which may never be greenlit if box office doesn't justify it which, in this post-covid world sounds somewhat unlikely. So what's part one like?My history of Dune and director Denis Villeneuve meant I was not hopeful. I read the novel in my teens in the 1960s and found it dense and impenetrable. David Lynch's movie had its moments, but got hacked about by the studio. The later TV series was more lucid, but suffered from some really poor casting and acting. And I had problems with Glade Runner 2049 and Arrival, both of which were a bit too cerebral for me, and less clear than I would have liked from a narrative stanndpoint.Dune (part one) 2021 is a fine film. It looks amazing, which one would expect these days. The casting - and acting - is excellent. And the script/adaptation is first rate. The power games which underlie the main plot are clear and obvious, the interplay of character dynamics is solid, subtle story points come through, all the little bits you need to understand are explained organically without huge obvious information dumps, and the story flows easily throughout the two and a half hours.I have two reservations. One, the film isn't as significant as it sometimes seems to think it is.

{"review": "Greetings again from the darkness. It's been nearly 40 years since David Lynch directed DUNE (1984). The film received an Oscar nomination for Best Sound, and has since been a cult favorite, though not one I'm particularly drawn to. All these years later, Frank Herbert's 1965 novel (there are 5 sequel novels) has been re-made by acclaimed writer-director Denis Villeneuve (ARRIVAL, 2016) and his co-writers Eric Roth (Oscar winner, FORREST GUMP, 1994) and Joe Spaihts (PROMETHEUS, 2012). The new version looks absolutely fantastic, even if the story is a bit convoluted and the characters don't always make the best, or even logical, decisions.The year is 10191, likely the most futuristic movie we've seen. Oscar Isaac is Duke Letto Atreides and Rebecca Ferguson is Lady Jessica Atreides, though the story mostly focuses on the son, Paul, played by Timothy Chalamet. The story revolves around the protection of spice, the most valuable resource in the universe/galaxy. However the real focus is on politics and power plays ... so I guess not much really changes over the next 8170 years - except, of course, the colonization and travel between multiple planets (surprisingly, none of these planets is named Elon or Bezos). There is much talk of \"the plan\" with emphasis on whether young Paul is \"the one\" mentioned in their legends. Paul does have some special abilities, but Chalamet's understated (and mostly monotone) portrayal makes everyone, even Lady Jessica, a bit unsure of whether he's the leader they need.The supporting cast is impressive and all do their part to drive the action and story forward. Jason Mamoa is Duncan Idaho, the warrior who humorously belittles Paul's fragile physical frame. Josh Brolin is Gurney Halleck, the bodyguard to the noble family, and Charlotte Rampling plays the Reverend Mother (a creepy nun). Oscar winner Javier Bardem is under-utilized as Stilgar, while Zendaya shines as Chani, one who bonds with Paul. Of course the most outrageous role finds Stellan Skarsgard (with some heavy make-up and special effects) as the grand emperor of Harkonnen, with Dave Bautista as his brother, the Beast.For me, the movie's technical aspects are what stand out. It deserves awards consideration in multiple categories, especially Sound, Visual Effects, Cinematography, and Score. Oscar winner Hans Zimmer really delivers a score that compliments and enhances what we see on screen. Cinematographer Greig Fraser has been involved in numerous high profile projects, like ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY (2016) and the highly anticipated THE BATMAN (coming in 2022). The effects are special and include the sandworms, as well as dragonfly choppers that are quite impressive. It was a bit annoying to see the desert sand blowing constantly, yet goggles and masks are hardly ever used. I guess these faces are too expensive to cover up!Familiarity abounds as some bits recall MAD MAX, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, STAR WARS, and THE MATRIX. Director Villeneuve shot the film in Norway and Jordan, and to answer the question from fans of the original ... no, Sting does not make a cameo appearance. The film looks stunning and will likely satisfy the target audience. Whether it's enough to expand the audience is something we will know soon enough. The film ends with \"This is only the beginning\", and Mr. Villeneuve has Dune Part Two in the planning stages.The film will be released October 22, 2021 in theaters, on IMAX, and streaming on HBO Max.", "helpfulness": 0.4700460829493088}
{"review": "Buying a bundle of Sci-Fi and Horror books on eBay shortly after the first Lockdown started in the UK, one of the books in the selection was Frank Herbert's Dune. Hearing over the years about it being a heavy-going novel, I was happily caught by surprised, when from the \"Fear is the mind-killer\" set-piece on page 19, I became completely gripped by this epic tale.Introduced after reading the novel by a friend to auteur film maker Denis Villeneuve's mesmerizing Arrival (2016-also reviewed) I started to look forward to his upcoming adaptation, leading to me booking a ticket for at The Printworks IMAX in Manchester (the second largest screen in Europe) to see the spice flow.View on the film:Building upon the cartel land desert of Sicario (2015-also reviewed) and the high granite walls of the alien spaceship in Arrival canvas, co-writer/ directing auteur Denis Villeneuve is joined by Foxcatcher (2014-also reviewed) cinematographer Greig Fraser to walk across the sand dunes with Villeneuve disincentive long establishing shots, which unleash an immerse atmosphere as long panning shots glide on the seamless blend of CGI and the real scotching hot heat from the Jordan and UAE locations.Opening up the aspect ratio to 1.43:1 for 60 minutes of the runtime, Villeneuve & his regular editor Joe Walker intelligently use the contrasting ratio to bring the startling visions of Paul, (played with a fitting dreamy haziness by Timothee Chalamet) into harsh, startling wide-shot white light focus, which melts into Hans Zimmer's excellent burning score engulfing the Atreides family in up-close realistic depictions of violence (a major recurring motif of Villeneuve.)Greeting Paul, Duke Leto and Lady Jessica (played with superb gravitas by Oscar Isaac and Rebecca Ferguson) as they land on Arrakis, the screenplay by Villeneuve, Doctor Strange (2016-also reviewed) co-writer Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth lovingly captures the vast universe Frank Herbert created, from the shadowy figures of the Baron (played by a chilling Stellan Skarsgard) and the Bene Gesserit Shakespearean witches, to the anti-Heroes Journey Paul goes on towards the mirage of Chani.The writers brilliantly bind all who inhabit Frank Herbert's world with the graves and recordings about other families who have tried to tame Arrakis for the Spice, only to discover that Arrakis is the graveyard of empires.", "helpfulness": 0.3877551020408163}

{"review": "I am one of those few people who thought Lynch's 1984 Dune was great. It was terribly edited and had other flaws, but it captured what I feel is the essence of the book. Of course it wasn't exactly like the book, it couldn't have been. Enter Denis's Dune, 2021, everything can be done on a computer, actors have had decades to refine the craft, films are not forced to be one hour and a half anymore, the budgets are astronomical. So how is it? I liked it, but I feel that it was something closer to what someone does after thinking for a long about how they would fix 1984 Dune rather than a reinterpretation of the book or even a very dry rerendering of it like the 2000 miniseries.There are two things I really didn't like. One of them is the flat refusal to do anything that might be considered R-rated. The film is butchered to blandness, even when it features vicious knife fights, large scale warfare and sadistic Harkonnen. Second is Jessica's character, who is portrayed as a weakling, rather than the incredibly resourceful Bene Gesserit who has been trained for years that she is. I love Rebecca Ferguson, but she is not right in this film and nor is her character.The visuals, while impressive, were kind of subdued, too. The mutated Navigators don't even make an appearance, the Harkonnen look big and fearsome, but clean and not really vile, the worms are shown with restraint, the colors are muted, the clothes and overall attire are simple, functional and uninteresting.Bottom line: I am sorry to say that I think Lynch's film would have probably been better if the same resources and artistic freedom would have been awarded to him. This Dune doesn't really show as much an improvement as 37 years of thinking about it should have warranted. And it is tame and lame, refusing to take the artistic risks that should have been taken to portray with today's technology and knowledge a world 8000 years into the future and described with so much care and attention in Herbert's books.Well, back to reading all the books again and dreaming for the next 40 years of an adaptation of God Emperor of Dune...", "helpfulness": 0.46782178217821785}

Money usually tempts film makers to try and harness another box office bonanza to make money for yourself too often.The film keeps focused on the story. They avoid other traps like throwing in relationships which are usually not even in novels to try and spice things up, or put in some Hollywood plot device to try to sell tickets. Here we find the story of the sand people. Getting this done better should have been a goal all along and here it is. Avoided also is speeding up the story to get it in in the traditional 2 hours.The story is set out dramatically at a pace which indeed is a bit slow, but allows the viewer time to make sense of the characters, and the atmosphere around them. I will not go into the details as it would be impossible to take enough space to describe all of it.

And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up. I do the same with my Greek and German/English.It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces. Some from the MCU and previous entries but also some from Asian cinema! Well done!", "helpfulness": 0.35331230283911674}
{"review": "There seemed to be a lot of inconsistencies in the story line, and that brought the film's credibility down a notch for this viewer. For example, during the insane bus fight scene, wouldn't you say that the Razor Fist (Florian Munteanu) was trying to kill Shaun (Simu Liu, before he was revealed as Shang-Chi)? That's what it looked like to me, but later it turned out that he was a strong arm for Shang-Chi's dad, Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). Wouldn't Wenwu be just a little PO'ed if the Razor guy actually hurt his son?Then there's the question of Shang-Chi's martial arts ability. After dispatching how many dozen fighters on the bus and on the scaffold, he gets blown out by his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) at the Golden Daggers Club. How? Similarly, Auntie Nan (Michelle Yeoh) doesn't have much trouble showing him what's what with her more elegant, flowing martial arts style. It seemed like Shang-Chi's ability got progressively worse as time went by, until the finale required him to rise to the occasion. And I can't for the life of me figure out why film makers can't make sure characters who use a bow and arrow get it right with the grip. When Katy (Awkwafina) takes up her archery practice, she squeezes the nock of the arrow between her fingertips, which is almost impossible with a high tension bow. The proper method calls for placing the nock between the index and middle finger on the bowstring. It allows for more accuracy, and you don't wind up with the arrow swinging up and down on the bow as you're trying to release it.Well, I guess that's enough ranting. The CGI special effects were quite astounding, I especially liked the colorful mythical creatures of Ta Lo. The martial arts sequences were exceptionally well choreographed as well, even though we know what's seen on screen is impossible in real life. The story itself was very much a rehash of hundreds of martial art film plots, which almost always seek vengeance for the death of a father, mother, mentor, master, take your pick. Even with that, it's an entertaining picture to watch, as the Ten Rings concept is given time to play out here, and in the expected sequel as well. As for that, the very final after, after, after credits scene appears to position Xu Xialing as the replacement for her father Wenwu at the head of the Ten Rings organization. We'll have to wait and see how Shang-Chi manages to deal with that whole scenario.", "helpfulness": 0.3235294117647059}
{"review": "The Marvel Cinematic Universe made a big impact with an almost all-black cast in Black Panther, then this film came along and gave the world its first high-profile Asian superhero, and from the trailer I saw, it looked very exciting. Basically, thousands of years ago, Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) discovered ten mystical iron rings, granting its user immortality and other great powers. He establishes the Ten Rings organisation and throughout history conquers kingdoms and topples governments. In 1996, wanting to expand his power, Wenwu goes in search for Ta Lo, a mystical heavenly realm inhabited by Chinese mythological creatures. He travels through a magical forest to the Ta Lo village entrance but is stopped by guardian Ying Li (Fala Chen). The two fall in love, but Li leaves with Wenwu when he is rejected by the villagers. Wenwu abandons the Ten Rings, and they have two children, Shang-Chi and Xialing. When Shang-Chi is seven years old (Jayden Zhang), Li is murdered by Wenwu's enemies, the Iron Gang. Wenwu once again wields the rings to massacre the Iron Gang, resumes leadership of his organisation, and has Shang-Chi go through brutal training in martial arts. Xialing from childhood (Elodie Fong) secretly copies this training. When Shang-Chi is fourteen (Arnold Sun), Wenwu sends him to assassinate the leader of the Iron Gang. But Shang-Chi is demoralised after fulfilling his mission and decides to run away to America, settling in San Francisco and changing his name to \"Shaun\". In the present day, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) works as a valet with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina), who knows nothing about his past. They are attacked on a bus by the Ten Rings, led by high-ranking agent Razor Fist (Florian \"Big Nasty\" Munteanu) who steal a pendant that Shang-Chi was given by his mother. Wenwu anonymously provides Shang-Chi with the location of his sister and, fearing that the Ten Rings will go after Xialing's matching pendant from their mother, Shang-Chi decides to meet her. He reveals his past to Katy, who insists on helping him. They find Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) at an underground fight club in Macau, which she founded after escaping from Wenwu. The Ten Rings attack the fight club and Wenwu arrives to capture Shang-Chi, Katy, Xialing, and her pendant. They are taken to the Ten Rings' compound, where Wenwu uses the pendants to reveal a magical map leading to Ta Lo. Wenwu explains that he has heard Li calling to him and believes she is alive and being held captive in Ta Lo behind a sealed gate. He plans to destroy the village unless they release her. When Shang-Chi, Xialing and Katy object, Wenwu imprisons them. Also incarcerated is former actor Trevor Slattery (Sir Ben Kingsley), whom the Ten Rings imprisoned for impersonating Wenwu, as The Mandarin, and his hundun companion Morris, who offers to guide them to Ta Lo. The group escapes and travel to Ta Lo, which exists in a separate dimension with various Chinese mythological creatures. They meet Ying Nan (Michelle Yeoh), Li's sister, who explains the history of Ta Lo: thousands of years ago, the village was attacked by the soul-consuming Dweller-in-Darkness and its minions but was saved by a Chinese dragon called the Great Protector who helped seal the Dark Gate to the Dweller's world. According to Nan, the Dweller-in-Darkness has been influencing Wenwu to believe Li is still alive so that he will open the Gate. Shang-Chi, Xialing, and Katy join the villagers in training and preparing for Wenwu's arrival, using outfits and weapons crafted from dragon scales. Wenwu and the Ten Rings arrive and attack. Wenwu overpowers Shang-Chi and forces him into the nearby lake, then destroys the Gate with the rings. Some of Dweller's minions escape, and the villagers join forces with the Ten Rings to fight them. Shang-Chi is revived by the Great Protector, which leaves the lake to battle the minions. Wenwu and Shang-Chi fight once more, with Shang-Chi gaining the upper hand, but he chooses to spare his father. The Dweller-in-Darkness escapes the weakened Gate and attacks Shang-Chi. Wenwu saves his son, bequeathing him the rings before being killed by the Dweller-in-Darkness. The Dweller-in-Darkness is eventually killed by the combined efforts of Shang-Chi, the Great Protector, Xialing, and Katy. Following the battle, Shang-Chi and Katy return to San Francisco where they are summoned by the sorcerer Wong (Benedict Wong) to the Sanctum Sanctorum. In a mid-credits scene, Wong introduces Shang-Chi and Katy to Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and Carol Danvers (Brie Larson). They discover that the ten rings are emitting a mysterious signal. In a post-credits scene, Xialing becomes the new leader of the Ten Rings after telling Shang-Chi that she was going to disband the organisation. Also starring Ronny Chieng as Jon Jon, Tsai Chin as Waipo, Yuen Wah as Master Guang Bo, Jodi Long as Mrs. Chen, Dallas Liu as Ruihua, Paul He as Chancellor Hui and Tsai Chin as Katy's grandmother, with the voice of Tim Roth as Abomination. Liu is suited nicely as the lead hero, Awkwafina is loveable as the hero's high-spirited best friend, Leung is interesting as the half-hero half-villain father, and there is good support from the likes of Yeoh and Kingsley. It is a simple story of a young man who must confront his past and use his mastery in weaponry-based Kung Fu to save the world, the highlights are the fight on the speeding bus and the final epic battle featuring dragons and mythical monsters, I agree the excellent special effects may swamp a lot of what is going on, but a well-written script, many fast-paces sequences, moments of humour, and nods to past martial arts movies help to smooth things out, all together it is an entertaining superhero fantasy action.

{"review": "Having seen the trailer for the 2021 Marvel action movie \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" I must admit that of course I was going to watch it, but I feared it would just be another run-of-the-mill-over-the-top-CGI-fest-but-barred-of-proper-contents Marvel movie. Yet, I opted to sit down and watch it, on the notion that it was a Marvel movie. But also because of the cast that starred in it.And yeah, this movie was over the top in terms of CGI. Of course it was, because it is a Marvel movie after all. But luckily this movie broke the formula of the archetypical Marvel movie and this actually turned out to be the best Marvel movie so far. Well, at least in my opinion. Why? Well, because of the storyline and the fact that it mixed Asian culture and lore into the Marvel cinematic universe, and it was a much needed addition to an otherwise Western-focused series of movies.The storyline told in \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\", as written by Dave Callaham, Destin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Lanham was certainly entertaining. And the movie didn't really have a dull moment, despite the fact that it was a movie that ran for 132 minutes. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie from beginning to end. And for me, this was a storyline with proper contents to it, that also included interesting characters and creatures.Visually then \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" blew me away. The CGI team really worked their magic with this movie and brought it to life in a very visually fulfilling way. Lots of nice details and jaw-dropping special effects. And the creature designs in the movie were off the charts, I really enjoyed seeing those brought to life on the screen.The character gallery in \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" was interesting, and that applies for both the villain and good guy side.And they had such a great cast ensemble put together for \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\", with the likes of Asian cinema heavy weighters such as Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, Michelle Yeoh and Wah Yuen. But the movie was also nicely carried by Simu Liu, whom I was not familiar with prior to this movie. And also having Awkwafina in the movie was just brilliant, because she put on a spot on performance with her comedy sidekick character. And it was interesting and nice to see Ben Kingsley return to reprise his character of Trevor Slattery.\"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" is a good combination of action and narrative storytelling, which made for a very wholesome movie. And it should be said that the action sequences were breathtaking to behold, so very, very nicely choreographed and executed on the screen, taking that traditional Wuxia elements seen in Asian movies and mixing it in with the archetypical Marvel Western-based superhero movies.I was more than genuinely entertained by \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" and it is certainly a movie that bolsters Marvel's hold for me, as their movies tend to be super flashy with spectacular effects, but rather hollow in terms of proper entertainment and storytelling.My rating of \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" lands on a well-deserved nine out of ten stars. Director Destin Denial Cretton ensured that this 2021 movie takes the role of the single best Marvel movie to date for me.", "helpfulness": 0.24362606232294617}

{"review": "I've said this before about Marvel movies: they are a victim of their own success. \"Shang-Chi\" had to follow up a decade and a half of quality MCU movies, so the same movie that would've been a smash 10 years ago isn't viewed quite the same today. The movie was good, but it failed to really separate itself.\"The Legend of Ten Rings\" as a title already sounds too much like LOTR. And in fact it was something like it in that he with the rings had the power. Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) had the ten rings which gave him near omnipotence. With the ten rings he could defeat entire armies and live forever. He decided to use the rings to become a tyrant.He was willing to put his rings aside and grow old for the love of his life, a woman he found after living 1000 years. I thought it was a bit strange that it took the man 1000 years to find his true love, but I didn't dwell on it.Stranger than him taking a thousand years to find his true love was the woman who fell in love with him. She lived in a secret magical village in Macao that was totally isolated from the rest of the world. She was a gentle benign character who had powers herself and was able to defeat Wenwu when he came to essentially conquer her village. Somehow, through their Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon-esque battle they fell in love. Maybe that makes sense for him being that he finally found someone who could defeat him, but it didn't make sense for this nearly pure woman to fall for a man with a 1000 year history of tyranny.Still, they wed, forsook their powers and started a family.Their family would be unceremoniously destroyed when an old foe of Wenwu--a vicious gang--came by their house to get their pound of flesh and killed Wenwu's wife, Li (Fala Chen). Li could've attempted to barter with them for some sort of material exchange for their past losses, but instead she immediately decided she'd try to fight the entire gang and lost her life in the process. That would cause Wenwu to don the ten rings again and return to tyranny.So, if you're keeping score on Wenwu's wife, 1.) she was smitten with a man who came to destroy her village and 2.) she chose to fight an entire gang with no powers to speak of and with no attempts to negotiate.I recognize that it was a plot device to advance the plot, but it could've been done a lot better and with more tact. Her character never struck me as someone impulsive and/or not able to judge character yet she exhibited both flaws.Most of what I've covered was garnered throughout the movie via flashbacks. The real main character was Saun aka Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). He was the son of Wenwu and Li. Years later we see an adult Saun. He lives in SF and is a valet. He is violently thrust back into the life he ran away from when his father's goons came for the pendant around his neck given to him by his mother. It was at this point we learned his backstory, of which I've given some already. We find out he also has a sister, Xialing (Meng'er Zhang), who Disney not so subtly informed us she had to train herself to become a fierce warrior because of her gender. The two of them had been split up for close to twenty years when Saun ran away after being trained to be an assassin by his father. He was fourteen at the time and she was ten when he promised her he'd be back. He never came back and when they met again in Macao as adults she held the same ten-year-old bitterness against him for running away as though a fourteen-year-old should've been more reliable. She greeted him with a butt-kicking that was twenty years in the making. It's clear that it never crossed her mind that he may have been killed, or maybe she would've considered his death a betrayal as well. Either way it was a completely childish way to handle reuniting with your long lost brother.The two of them would join forces along with Saun's friend Katy (Awkwafina) and really quickly to stop their father. He was going to use the ten rings to breach a portal to another dimension which contained some soul-sucking demons.The introduction of demons to the movie did offer some excitement. It upped the stakes of everyone involved and thrust another Marvel character into the role of saving the world.Saun would save the world with the help of his friends and family. Some would die, but the most important characters lived. I was somewhat satisfied with the movie. The acting was commendable and Awkwafina was good as the comic relief. \"Shang-Chi\" may just be the placement of a singular brick to build to something bigger, I just hope what Marvel is building towards is worth it.", "helpfulness": 0.5125628140703518}
{"review": "It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing). That was also when he last spent time with his sister, Xialing(Zhang, a badass who deserves more screen time. Honestly, I'd be very surprised if she didn't, in future projects). He's joined by his friend Katy(Awkwafina, quirky, providing a lot of comic relief, something I'm told she's in general adept at), for what can best be described as a tense reunion, which allows the movie to really mine the family melodrama, one of the best elements it has. I won't give away exactly what the antagonist intends to do, only that our hero has to stop him. However, he has to figure out how, maybe even if, that is even possible.Not quite, yet almost \"Black Panther for Asian audiences\", this does a lot for representation(including for women. Some of the best characters in this are female. In addition to the two that I've already mentioned, there is also Ying Nan(Yeoh, wise)), it is positively drenched in Chinese culture(the third act, while in ways it feels like it belongs to a completely different film than the first two, takes an especially deep dive into that. Ultimately, it is presented through a Western lens, and clearly we need to go further in this direction, still, it is a big deal that they put so much of it in an estimated $150 to 200 million major blockbuster, which will be seen by millions of people who would never consider watching an art picture, especially one focusing on a group they don't belong to), to the point where countless times, when it makes sense, major characters in this speak Mandarin to each other, rather than English, which it is subtitled into. And \"don't worry\", for those who think that the following is important: there are white people on screen, and they aren't made out to be \"less than\".The action(each sequence of which feels distinct, belongs with the rest, and is memorable) pays tribute to many different kinds of martial arts films, acknowledging that they are standing on the shoulders of giants. Jackie Chan, wuxia, etc. The choreography is matched in skill by the cinematography. Not only are we seeing incredible fighting, the camera is dynamic, celebrating and highlighting how incredible it is. That *is* why you hire Bill Pope, the director of photography on the Matrix trilogy, two of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man entries, Darkman and Team America. The special effects are excellent. There are some issues with pacing, and certainly a chunk of this is composed almost entirely of flashbacks.This features relatively brief but highly concentrated, surprisingly graphic gore(you know, there was a time when the fact that it's happening to beings that clearly are not human, wasn't enough to get away with this kind of thing with a PG-13 rating. Pepperidge Farm remembers), as well as a little strong language. I recommend this to any fan of comic book movie adaptations, and people passionate about diversity hiring. 8/10.", "helpfulness": 0.2573099415204678}

{"review": "\"The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange.\" Wenwu (Tony Leung)This quote is typical of the light-hearted but also serious addition to the MCU that is Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Although Marvel has always been less serious than DC, this time it leaves Superman and Batman to cry in their capes. Sweet superhero Sean/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) has more humanity than almost any other hero, and he uses his martial arts only when pressed.The opening sequence on a bus (you can see the bad coming from other cinematic bus rides such as in Nobody) is rousing and entertaining. It has a fight sequence I laughed through because of its ballet-like composition but satisfying because it sets up character and motivation.When things get heavy, and they do because Sean must confront and potentially kill his 1000-year-old mobster dad, Wenwu, Awkwafina's Katy, Sean's girlfriend, is there with amusing one-liners throughout the adventure, right down to a life-saving shot in the big ending battle scene.Director Destin Daniel Cretton deftly orchestrates his fights and his characters' lines with the authority of a much more seasoned filmmaker. He never loses sight of the central motif-the affirmation of family primacy, so that the potential chaos of a giant cast and multiple plot strands hosts a unity glued by character and dialogue.Shang-Chi is a Marvel for the whole family and especially the cinephiles curious how The Marvel Cinematic Universe can be so diverse, so entertaining, and so perfect a purveyor of our heroic fantasies.", "helpfulness": 0.3111111111111111}

{"review": "'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be. Not only does it feel like a Marvel movie, it feels like a literal Disney movie as well. This is often detrimental to the overall affair, as the piece should have been much more unique than it ultimately is, and it makes for a much less interesting watch overall. However, the formula it follows has provided plenty of success in the past; this time is no exception. Its highs are where you'd expect them to be, as are its lows, and there is an undeniable sense of fun, albeit cookie-cutter fun, to be had. The film is an entertaining action adventure that follows a young man whose criminal father calls him and his sister back home in order to lay siege to the mystical village he believes is holding his wife, the protagonist's mother, hostage. The villain's motivation is a little underexplored yet entirely understandable. It comes from a believable emotional place and is more satisfying because of it. The relationship between the lead and his no-good dad isn't explored as much as it could be, though, and the flick generally has a bit of a theming issue. The piece tries to tie its events directly into the wants and needs of its lead characters, but it does so in an unsatisfyingly half-baked way and honestly would probably have been better if it played itself as more of a straightforward adventure ala most of the 'Mission: Impossible (1996-)' series. Still, the touches of character development are appreciated and each lead player is written to be as likeable as possible. This, combined with the amicable performances, means that you care about the heroes even though you don't have all that much reason to. This keeps you invested in their stories throughout. The highlight of the entire affair is, for sure, its action. For the most part, the picture stays towards the right end of the practical to CG spectrum. The fights are never exactly realistic, per se, but they're based on competent choreography and clean camerawork. They're, more often than not, really entertaining. Sadly, the flick inches closer and closer towards the wrong end of the aforementioned spectrum the longer it goes on. By the time it reaches its finale (which gives me major 'Fast And Furious Presents Hobbs And Shaw (2019)' vibes for some reason), it's clear that the balance it previously achieved is going to go out of the window. Sure enough, its climactic battle is an entirely computer-generated affair; it isn't all that compelling and goes directly against what made the movie so enjoyable to begin with. No matter how hard it tries to disguise it, it still ends with a big blue beam in the sky. Still, the finale isn't exactly bad. It's just annoyingly intangible and feels a little forced in, even (as do the rather cringe-worthy post-credits scenes). Ultimately, this is a generic yet entertaining experience. Its charming acting and exciting action are clearly its highlights, and its weakest aspects are still decent enough. It's a good movie. However, I can't deny that Marvel fatigue is becoming more and more pertinent in my mind. You know what you're going to get before you get it. Plus, the studio's insistence that it has to perforate every single outing with references to other, almost entirely irrelevant fare is really annoying. Although most of their movies are at least okay, I find myself not caring at all about them. That's sad, really, considering that the MCU has produced some genuinely great pictures in the past. 7/10.", "helpfulness": 0.20689655172413793}

I promise, it's worth itWOWOWOWOWOW. This movie blew me away. I love it. A LOT. From beginning to end. Everything. I walked out of the movie so hyped, silent-screaming under my mask as i walked to the car. It's been a while since i walked out of a movie this happy. I have so much to say.I love the MCU (a lot), but there are a few things that are frequently lacking. One of them is good fight scenes. They always have awesome action scenes, but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good, only great in a few movies like civil war and winter soldier. And in general, fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema (Ip man, The Raid Redemption, anything Jackie Chan).The fight scenes in this movie.... how do i describe it... amazing martial arts that's fast but clear, filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts, against stunningly beautiful backdrops... phenomenal. And they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 10 seconds like i've noticed in the MCU.This is BY FAR the best fighting in the MCU and it's not even close. Has to be up there with the John Wick series and Netflix's Daredevil as some of the best we've seen in America lately. I loved the first major fight scene so much that i was worried it would be the best one of the movie, far too early. Lol. I be stupid sometimesAnother frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain. Nope. Awesome awesome awesome. That's all i'll say.Another of my frequent complaints is that the musical scores, with some exceptions, don't stand out. I think they heard. They're on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow. It's not as amazing as the Loki score but i liked it. It felt unique to this new franchise.Still so much more to say, need to go faster. This is one of the best, maybe THE best, story in the MCU, especially the way it's told. I loved all the characters, i loved all the casting choices, i loved the performances. There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps. All the emotional moments hit. All the callbacks hit. There isn't anything that didn't work for me. There's no such thing as a perfect movie, but mannnnnn.Lmao i didn't mention the cinematography. Why would i wait this long? It's MESMERIZING. A lot. Throughout. It's candy for your eyes.It's also nice to see well-written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters, that feels organic. As opposed to the \"insert joke here\" method we've been seeing more of, especially in Far From Home.What's the opposite of formulaic? That's this movie. I never knew what to expect next (helps that i didn't watch a single trailer, they ruin movies). Definitely doesn't feel like a typical MCU movie. It has it's own unique tone and feel and character.Continuing what i said in my headline, i have this thing where i get goosebumps and start tearing up, not from an emotional moment, but from a scene being so incredible, especially action scenes. Don't know why it happens, don't know if it happens to other ppl. Maybe it's partly because i can't risk blinking. That happened in this movie numerous times. Like \"this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life.\" hyperbole, but mannnnnafter endgame finished phase 3 (yes i know spider-man), i was so happy and satisfied with the MCU. But i wasn't sure they could ever recapture that magic again. I knew i would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome. But i wasn't expecting top-tier stuff any more. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated. As of now, this is a top 6 MCU movie for me. WowAll in all, i adore this movie. You may wonder why i wouldn't give it a 10 after all this raving. 10s are super rare for me, only 13 of them, and i watch thousands of movies. Interstellar, inception, mad max fury road, etc. Movies that shouldn't even be called movies. My 9s are rare too, they are my favorite movies. 10s are my favorites of my favorites. Only superhero movies i've given 10s are dark knight, dark knight rises and civil war.If you're still reading, wow you're awesome! I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar.I'm still in such a good mood. I can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX.

My only complaint is that it is a bit too long. It's still amazing with gorgeous designs of the creatures. It truly is a unique film to have a mostly all-Asian cast in a superhero movie.

{"review": "Like Marvel films better than some do, have never been and never will be part of this ridiculous MCU vs DCU war, and the positive critical reception drew me in to seeing 'Deadpool 2'. Being someone who really enjoyed 'Deadpool', though not completely loving it, expectations were high for the sequel and they were met. Like 'Deadpool', 'Deadpool 2' was very entertaining, and again credit is due for trying to take more of a comedic edge to a genre that can be taken seriously (sometimes overly so) and for taking risks. It's also a very good film and count me in as another person who found it an even better film than its predecessor (not many superior sequels out there), being funnier and more ambitious with a much better and memorable villain.'Deadpool 2' for me did have its issues. There are instances where the special effects are rather ropy and artificial-looking.Also personally found Julian Dennison on the annoying side and parts of the story are disjointed.\n However, 'Deadpool 2' is very well made visually. Slick, stylish and brooding with generally typically well crafted effects. The music is haunting and rousing and most of the direction is very assured and sharp, and more in control of the tonal balances. The action is dynamically choreographed and exciting (the parachuting is unforgettable), the scale bigger and bolder, and the romantic and emotional elements just about avoid the mawkish sentimentality trap and instead give 'Deadpool 2' its heart. While not quite as resonant as in the first 'Deadpool' there is more of the man behind the mask.Most of the humour is very funny and has enough freshness, though its extremely black and sometimes crude comedic nature again has proven to be an acquired taste. The jokes are more consistent and there are less \"don't quite land\" ones, while there is the vulgarity, the crudeness does not go overboard. As said, that it, like the first 'Deadpool', that tried to incorporate humour into an often taken seriously genre was interesting and refreshing. The story is a pretty lightweight one structurally, while showing more ambition in depth and scale than its predecessor, and is occasionally disjointed, but the hugely energetic pace, emotion, tension and sense of fun elevated it. The final act is much better here, more exciting, less muddled and doesn't feel rushed.Ryan Reynolds brings charismatic charisma, vulnerability and great comic timing to the title role, one he was born to play and he successfully allows one to root for his character. Even better is a brilliant Josh Brolin, bringing all the qualities, but with more gruffness and even more menace, that made Thanos in 'Avengers: Infinity War' such a great character and makes Cable a significant improvement by far over the villain in the first film, being actually memorable. Zazie Beetz was a fun addition as Domino (don't agree with the criticisms directed against her), Morena Baccarin and her chemistry with Reynolds still has heart and all the cameos from the X-force members sparkle.Overall, highly entertaining and a sequel and overall film that ticked most of the right boxes. 8/10 Bethany Cox", "helpfulness": 0.5454545454545454}

Usually I'm not a fan of Reynolds but he fits the role well here and a lot of his quick-wire dialogue is funny, with plenty of satirical and witty humour littered amid the crudity. This sequel is slightly worse than the first film, but at least it's fast-paced and action-packed.

He recruits other mutants like Domino (Zazie Beetz) to join his X-Force to battle Cable and rescue Russel.Starting the movie by killing Vanessa puts a damper on the proceedings. I understand Deadpool's idea of providing motivation for this movie. It's just a downer in this otherwise hilarious fun. Of course, one does quickly realize that Cable has his time traveling powers to change any of these events. Colossus and Negasonic are as good as before. Cabbie Dopinder continues his hilarity.

{"review": "The first film did more than enough to make me look forward to the sequel, even if the film itself was not as good as the promotional work ahead of it. So it is again here, as very funny adverts and promos got me excited but at the same time meant that the film didn't quite deliver in the same way. To be fair, this is because it is a two-hour film, so not easy to do the same as a few minute spot or bit. This can be seen in a few bumps along the way of the film - plot points which need to be delivered but do take the film away from joking or doing action, which is really where it works best.Outside of these bumps though, the film gets the mood right, with irreverent humor and solid action sequences. It is pretty polished and professional, which does take away from its attempts to appear to have rough edges, but it works nonetheless. The comedy is broad and knowing; mostly this is at a level which is amusing but it does periodically have plenty of good laughs or clever moments. Likewise the action sequences are rarely thrilling, but they do have enough about them to inject energy and plenty of noise.All told, a pretty consistent and enjoyable film which steps up from the first film while still keeping what made it work.", "helpfulness": 0.0}

But if you are with Ryan Reynolds, you love this as much as he does and you will have a great time. This ups the ante and has even more jokes, even small ones, where they actually are able to have big names for a punch line hired or just a visual joke.Very funny, if you don't mind the non political correct route it takes ... because this is anything but nice ... and still manages to be sweet in its own right!", "helpfulness": 0.75}
{"review": "After seeing the first Deadpool movie, I pretty much vowed that I would never watch a sequel because of all the vulgarity and nudity in the original. But then I thought, how can I be a Marvel movie completist without seeing this one, so I had to finally break down and catch it. Well, I wasn't as offended by this picture, as the use of the 'F' word seemed to be somewhat curtailed, and the nudity was removed except for that extremely juvenile scene in which Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) sprouted a young boy's legs. Oh, and Juggernaut's behind, but that was more gross than sexually explicit. Personally, I don't see how any of that adds to a movie's popularity, if it wasn't in there you'd never miss it. Where the picture excels is in the edgy humor and clever writing, the introduction of the X-Force characters a case in point. The only one in the story I couldn't warm up to was Russell/Firefist (Julian Dennison); for me, he had no charisma or likeability at all. Josh Brolin was surprisingly effective as Cable, even more so than Thanos in the Avengers franchise. Which leads me to consider, how lucky is it that a single actor gets to portray two iconic comic-book figures? It's like Ryan Reynolds showing up in both the Marvel and DC comic book universes on film, which by the way, led to a cool after credits gag dissing the Green Lantern persona like he did in the first movie. The one disappointment I had was not seeing Marvel comic book legend Stan Lee show up in this picture, or if he did have a cameo, I somehow missed it. However his name isn't in the list of cast credits, and with his recent passing just a few days ago on 11/12/18, his presence in future Marvel flicks will be sorely missed.Oh yeah, and if you do an internet search on 'dubstep', the comments section of any hit will tell you that \"Deadpool 2\" sent the reader there. The power of pop culture.Addendum**** 7-2-2019 - Upon rewatching the film today, I caught a Stan Lee tribute where his face is painted on the side of a huge building with the notation: \"R.I.P.

{"review": "This first movie was a terrifically funny alternative superhero movie, with its middle finger-brandishing spirit, there were high hopes for another slice of the spin-off from the Marvel X-Men series, we got it, and I wondered if it would be as much enjoyable, directed by David Leitch (Atomic Blonde). Basically foul-mouthed mutant mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) has been Deadpool for the last two years, and it is his anniversary with girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), he is delighted when she wants to start a family. As Deadpool, Wade failed to kill a target, this assassin tracks them down and kills Vanessa, he kills the man in revenge, and blames himself for her death, six weeks later he attempts to commit suicide, blowing himself up. Wade has a vision of Vanessa in the afterlife, but his body pieces remain alive and he is put back together by Colossus (Stefan Kapicic), Wade is left only with a Skee-Ball token as an anniversary gift and final memento of Vanessa. Wade recovers with his healing abilities at the X-Mansion, he agrees to join the X-Men as a form of healing, he joins Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) at a standoff between authorities and unstable young mutant Russell Collins aka Firefist (Julian Dennison) at an orphanage. Deadpool realises Russell has been abused by one of the orphanage staff, he kills one of the staff members, Colossus stops him killing anyone else, Deadpool and Russell are arrested. They are taken to the \"Icebox\", an isolated prison for mutant criminals, and restrained with collars that suppress their powers. Meanwhile, a cybernetic soldier from the future, Cable (Josh Brolin), has travelled back in time to find Russell, his family were murdered in the future by an older Russell, he has come to kill the boy before he ever becomes a killer. Cable breaks into the Icebox and attacks Russell, Wade's collar is damaged in the chaos, he attempts to defend Russell, Cable takes Vanessa's token, forcing Wade and him out of prison, but not before Russell overhears Wade deny that he cares about him. Near death again, Wade has another vision of Vanessa, she convinces him to help Russell, so when he recovers, Wade organises a team called X-Force to break Russell out of a prison-transfer convoy and defend him from Cable. Deadpool advertises for anyone with superhuman abilities to apply, mutants recruited are Domino (Zazie Beetz), who has the manipulative ability of luck, along with Bedlam (Terry Crews), Shatterstar (Lewis Tan), Zeitgeist (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) and the invisible Vanisher (Brad Pitt), and human Peter (Rob Delaney) is recruited, he applied because he thought it would be fun. The team launches its assault on the convoy by parachuting from a helicopter, but all team members, except for Deadpool and the lucky Domino, die during the landing. While Deadpool and Domino fight Cable on the fast-moving convoy, Russell frees mutant inmate Juggernaut (voiced by Reynolds), he agrees to repay Russell by helping him to kill the abusive orphanage headmaster (Eddie Marsan), Juggernaut destroys the truck and he and Russell escape. Cable agrees to work with Deadpool and Domino to stop Russell from committing his first murder, that would send him on the future path, he agrees to give Wade the chance to talk Russell down before attempting to kill the boy again. They arrive at the orphanage, they are overpowered by Juggernaut, while Russell attacks the headmaster, and Colossus, who at first refused to help Wade due to his murderous ways, shows up to help and allow Wade and Cable to confront Russell. After it appears that Wade fails in talking Russell down, Cable shoots at the young mutant, Wade leaps in front of the bullet, wearing an Icebox collar, causing him to die, reuniting him with Vanessa in the afterlife. Seeing the sacrifice, Russell no longer wants to kill the headmaster, this changes the future, Cable's family will now survive. But Cable uses his final charge on his time-travelling device, needed to return to his family, to go back several minutes and strap Vanessa's token onto his chest to deflect the bullet. Deadpool survives, Russell still has his change of heart, and the headmaster is run over by Wade's taxi driver friend Dopinder (Karan Soni). In the mid credits, Negasonic Teenage Warhead and her girlfriend Yukio (Shioli Kutsuna) repair Cable's time-traveling device for Wade, this allows him to travel back in time to save the lives of Vanessa and Peter, he also rights some wrongs, by killing the X-Men Origins: Wolverine version of Deadpool and killing actor Ryan Reynolds while reading the script for Green Lantern. Also starring T.J. Miller as Weasel and Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, and cameos by Nicholas Hoult as Beast, James McAvoy as Charles Xavier, Evan Peters as Quicksilver, Tye Sheridan as Cyclops, Alexandra Shipp as Storm, Kodi Smit-McPhee as Nightcrawler and Stan Lee on a mural. Reynolds is again fantastic as the wisecracking anti-hero, he does many more fourth wall breaks, send-ups of clich\u00e9s and in-jokes, Brolin (who is also Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War, released only a month before this) is also great as the complex and compelling antagonist. The first film was funny, action-packed and fun, well this sequel is even better, many more explosive moments in the many fight and chases sequences, and visually stunning special effects, and it is hilariously funnier, with its black comedy violence, more vulgar language and bitch-slapping of past superhero movies, the highlights are an opening credits sequence with \"Ashes\" by Celine Dion, spoofing James Bond opening titles, and Flashdance (with bullets instead of water), and the genius end credits sequence and end song, overall it is a brilliant fantasy action comedy.

{"review": "As this sequel begins the unkillable superhero is trying to kill himself. A short flashback sequence shows the tragic events that led up to this. Inevitably he doesn't die; Colossus recovers his body parts and puts him back together. He is encouraged to become a trainee X-man but his first mission goes wrong; he realises the out of control young mutant, Russell, he is meant to stop is actually being abused at a Mutant Re-education Centre and kills one of the abusers. Deadpool and Russell are taken to a high security facility where control collars supress their mutant powers. While there Cable, a super-soldier from the future, turns up determined to kill Russell for crimes he has yet to commit. During the fight Deadpool gets out of the facility but Russell is left behind; convinced he has been abandoned. Deadpool determines to rescue him; to do that he assembles his own team of superheroes: The X-Force. Not surprisingly things do not go according to plan.If you enjoyed the original 'Deadpool' you are sure to love this; it has all the irreverence that made the original so much fun. It may be crude and violent but it isn't mean-spirited. The story starts well with his explosive suicide attempt; this is followed by a fun flashback sequence where he kills bad guys as Dolly Parton's 'Nine to Five' plays in the background (priceless) followed by a shocking tragedy. This all serves to lead to the main story about Deadpool's attempt to save Russell... this contains lots of action and plenty of good twists. Cable made a good adversary for Deadpool and the X-Force members were amusing, even if mostly ineffectual. Ryan Reynolds really carries the film as Deadpool; he is really great I the role; Josh Brolin impresses as Cable and Zazie Beetz is a lot of fun as the lucky X-Force member, Domino.

Starting his life as Wade Wilson, he gave himself over to Department H, the same group that gave Wolverine his adamantium skeleton, in the hopes of curing his cancer. Yes, I wrote all of the paragraph from memory. I can go deep on the X-Men.Even more complicated is Cable, the hero/villain of this film. Man, it takes a paragraph to explain him. He's the son of Cyclops and Madelyne Pryor, who is a clone of Jean Grey. He was given a techno-organic virus by Apocalypse and raised in the future by a psychic projection of his parents before coming back to our time as a much older, much more hardened mercenary who gathered the New Mutants as X-Force to stop the end of the world that his clone Stryfe would bring about. You don't need to know any of that to enjoy this movie. I know all of it. I also didn't get laid until I was 23. Such is comic books.That said - Deadpool screws up and his life is ruined, so he becomes obsessed with ending his life. Then, he meets the teenage mutant Firefist (based on New Mutant Rusty Collins, played by Julian Dennison from Hunt for the Wilderpeople) who needs a friend. Of course, Deadpool screws that up. Then, he joins the X-Men and screws that up. Then, he forms X-Force. And screws that up. Basically, most of the movie is Deadpool being a colossal failure until he learns how he can finally die and be happy. Or not. I'm not gonna spoil it for you.I'm also not going to spoil the big bad guy reveal either.

{"review": "Not only must good sequels live up to the original, but they must also transcend it. \"Atomic Blonde\" director David Leitch's \"Deadpool 2\" makes Tim Miller's \"Deadpool\" appear almost prudish, boasting thrice as much profanity, promiscuity, and pyrotechnics, including our protagonist's smart-aleck asides to the audience. You've got to be a little warped yourself to appreciate Deadpool's antics. Make no mistake, \"Deadpool\" started the next stride in the evolution of cinematic costume-clad crimefighters. Starting with several \"X-Men\" (2000) epics, sequels and prequels, \"Spider-Man\" (2002) sequels and reboots, \"The Fantastic Four\" (2005) and its sequel \"The Rise of the Silver Surfer,\" and then \"Iron Man\" (2008), \"The Incredible Hulk\" (2008), \"Thor\" (2011), \"Captain America\" (2011), \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" (2014), \"Ant Man\" (2015), \"Doctor Strange\" (2016), and \"Black Panther\" (2017), the Marvel Cinematic Universe has outperformed its venerable rivals in the DC Universe, spouting risqu\u00e9 humor with PG-13 restraint, engaging characters, all swirled with sensational CGI. Although \"Deadpool\" (2016) never takes himself seriously, Ryan Reynolds is seriously sidesplitting. Skewering everything and everybody as well as himself and the eponymous character, Ryan Reynolds qualifies as the perfect match with 'the merc with a mouth.' Shattering the status quo PG-13 barrier, \"Deadpool\" plunged gleefully into forbidden R-rated territory. Earlier, no Hollywood studio would have green-lighted such an unconventional movie. Nothing in the \"Deadpool\" universe is safe from our crimson clad crimefighter's subversive sense of humor. If \"Deadpool\" ranked as the first exception to the rule, Hugh Jackman's, R-rated, swan-song \"Logan\" (2017) confirmed superheroes could thrive in an R-rated universe. \"Deadpool 2\" delivers every dollar's worth of its $110-million budget in energetic stunts, a James Bond opening credits parody, and a stouthearted Marvel character co-star who never lets Deadpool overshadow him. A minute under of two hours, \"Deadpool 2\" provides everything Reynolds promised during his after-credits \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" scene in the original. \"Deadpool 2\" begins with Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds of \"Green Lantern\"), aka 'Deadpool,' struggling to keep his gal, Vanessa (Morena Baccarin of \"Serenity\"), out of harm's way. Unfortunately, he cannot protect her when gunmen invade their apartment, and Vanessa dies from a fatal bullet! Tragedy strikes early in this rambunctious sequel, and Vanessa remains on 'the other side' for most of it! A grief-stricken Deadpool catches her killer, disposing of him painfully as only Deadpool can, and then he obliterates himself in a fireball inferno. As all Deadpool fans know, Deadpool is indestructible as long as he has his superpowers. Mind you, he cannot kill himself, courtesy of Ajax's cancer treatments inflicted on him in \"Deadpool.\" Incredibly, Deadpool's body rejuvenates itself! During a momentary absence, Wade visits Vanessa in 'the other world.' Initially, Vanessa had wanted to have a baby, but a bullet destroyed those dreams. Now, Wade Williams/Deadpool vows to save a child. This child is an obese teen with an attitude, Russell Collins (Julian Dennison of \"Shopping\"), who has suffered grievously at the hands of workers in an orphanage. Russell can summon flamethrower fires from his blazing hands, and he vows to incinerate the perverted Headmaster. A sympathetic Deadpool befriends Russell, but the two land in 'the Icebox' Prison, where our hero loses his superpowers. He advises Russell to find somebody else. No sooner are they behind bars than a vengeful Cable (Josh Brolin of \"Sicario\") appears. Cable storms the mutant prison located in an isolated snow-covered mountain range. An indomitable half-man, half-cyborg, equipped with massive firepower, he blasts away at Russell. A flashforward reveals Russell cremated Cable's wife and daughter, after the teen had grown up. Cable plans to liquidate him before Russell grows old enough to harm his loved ones. However, Cable must bypass Deadpool, but Deadpool refuses to accommodate him. Not only does grim-looking Cable resemble the Terminator, but he is also every bit as alarming. Deadpool compares him with 'the Winter Soldier.' A straight-forward, time-traveling titan on a personal vendetta, Cable has no tolerance for humor. Cable makes the perfect straight man, and the granite-jawed Brolin looks born to play the character. He disparages Deadpool as \"an annoying clown dressed up as a sex toy.\" Cable looks nothing like Thanos. Another Marvel character who hasn't been seen since \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" appears in one of the more dynamic action scenes. After Deadpool abandons Russell, Russell forges a friendship with Juggernaut. Juggernaut is a muscle-bound behemoth who wears a lampshade helmet. Inevitably, Colossus and Juggernaut tangle, in a reprise of Colossus's clash with Angel Dust (Gina Carano) in the original. Deadpool resolves to thwart Cable and rescue Russell during an armored prison convoy transfer. Assembling team 'X-Force,' a bunch of mutant half-wits, he uses them to hijack the convoy. Their mission is doomed from the start, and Deadpool must contend with trigger-happy Cable as well as the barbarous Juggernaut. Amidst all this turmoil, Russell's chief adversary, the despicable Headmaster (Eddie Marsan of \"The World's End\"), makes an unforgettable impression despite the modicum of time allowed him. \n\"Atomic Blonde\" director David Leitch sets several exhilarating, over-the-top, acrobatic faceoffs to venerable Top-40 hit tunes. The action erupts with Deadpool's world tour where he assails crime families everywhere and racks up a double-digit body count. Indeed, \"Deadpool 2\" bristles with more scenes of simulated cinematic violence than its predecessor. Leitch's polished directorial flare; the top-drawer CGI effects; and Ryan Reynolds' nonstop humor distinguish this superior sequel. The scene where Deadpool shoots Ryan Reynolds as he reads the \"Green Lantern\" screenplay is riotous. Not as atrocious as Reynolds argues, \"Green Lantern\" went belly-up at the box-office, and he maintains his contempt for it here as he did in \"Deadpool.\" \"Deadpool\" scenarists Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, along with Reynolds, make nothing easy for our protagonist. He suffers several setbacks. The Brad Pitt cameo highlights the hilarious \"X-Force\" debacle as well as the X-Men that Wade overlooks at the mansion. Altogether, \"Deadpool 2\" is far more entertaining and uproarious than \"Deadpool,\" and the writers create greater depth and spontaneity in this follow-up.", "helpfulness": 0.3333333333333333}
{"review": "After his trials and tribulations in the first movie, the life of Wade Wilson (aka Deadpool) has now settled down. He's still killing bad guys, but it's more business-as-usual now. Moreover, he and girlfriend Vanessa are madly in love and want to start a family. Then a tragic event throws his life into disarray.The first Deadpool movie was great, and was a very pleasant surprise, being a comic book movie. Instead of the usual CGI-driven, all style no substance, drivel that most comic book movies are, Deadpool was a comedy, and a really good one. Outrageously funny, original and entertaining. Clever, snappy, laugh-a-minute dialogue. Some great cultural references and in-jokes, especially regarding other comic book movies.Deadpool 2 continues in the same vein. Some brilliantly funny, laugh-out-loud moments, often based around in-jokes, cultural references and film-industry-deprecating humour.More action than the first, which is disappointing. Part of Deadpool's charm is that it parodies other comic book movies. By becoming an action movie it threatens to become what it is parodying. There's always an element of humour involved though, even in the deadliest fight scenes, and in so doing the writer and director manage to avoid the hypocrisy of the film becoming what it mocks.Great work again from Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool: his comedic timing and delivery is spot-on.

What reason does he have to kill a teenager?Other than ditching the flashback aspect of the structure(the rest remains in place), and obviously the origin story, since that's out of the way, this is the same movie as we got the first time. Except it's bigger, and somewhat different in a few other necessary ways. As much as I love the 2016 film, in most ways, this is an improvement. Obviously the action and scope are increased, since the budget is. But in other areas, more is a good, not bad, thing. This time around, quipping isn't limited to the title character and Weasel(Miller, admittedly funny, despite, as we now know, being a scumbag), rather, basically every major character gets to(adding to the overall world having that flavor, which it already did to some extent). And they all get to be memorable in other ways as well. While I'll admit that the larger cast worried me, they gave everyone the right amount of screen time. With nearly all major scenes and jokes revisited or redone in some way(since they worked the first time), it's noteworthy and impressive that they're greater here. With few exceptions. The franchise building, though the marketing can make it seem obtrusive and excessive, is handled well.

{"review": "Greetings again from the darkness. We couldn't help but ask \"why?\" when the sequel was announced, even though we knew the answer was money. There was little hope in improving on the first DEADPOOL (2016), and since that film's director, Tim Miller, was tied up with upcoming projects for X-Men and Terminator, there was understandable concern that changing the recipe could result in huge disappointment. While it may not be an improvement on the first, only those with unrealistic expectations are likely to be disappointed ... the rest of us will spend most of two hours laughing and enjoying the spectacle.Director David Leitch exploded onto the scene with last year's surprise action hit ATOMIC BLONDE, and his stuntman experience is once again on display with even more frenzied action and fight sequences this time out. As you might expect, there is no easing into the comedy routine here. The Opening Credits are laugh out loud funny and the only thing better may be the closing credits sequence, which is an instant classic.No punchlines will be spoiled here, and it's an obvious statement, but clearly no topic or subject, or at least very few, are off-limits. Targets of barbs include LinkedIn, YENTL, FROZEN, Fox & Friends, and well, the list goes on and on. You'll likely miss 20 percent of the dialogue whilst laughing. The \"Merc with a Mouth\" breaks the 4th wall in atypical fashion - blurring the line through dialogue incorporated into the story. The self-awareness is comical in its own right.Some familiar faces are back. Wade's main squeeze Vanessa (Marina Baccarin) kicks off the \"kids\" discussion (Yikes!) and the couple seems to have settled into cohabitant bliss - never a good sign in a superhero movie. TJ Miller (despite his recent headlines) is back running Sister Margaret's Bar, though his minimal presence is noted. Also back is Colossus (voiced by Stefan Kapicic), and his expanded role finds him turning Deadpool into an X-Men trainee at Professor Xavier's School for the gifted. This occurs after tragedy strikes and we are introduced to some new players. Julian Dennison (so good in HUNT FOR THE WILDERBEAST) plays FireFist, and of course, the arrival of Cable (Josh Brolin) shows us what happens when a time-travelling Terminator type is out for revenge. Snarking, mocking and irreverence remain in full force throughout, but if you happen to pay attention to the story, you'll notice a (not-so) subtle transition taking place. The renegade superhero shifts from loner to team player, and even picks up some life lessons along the way - mostly related to loss and collaboration. Deadpool even forms his own team called X-Force, and one of the more interesting members is Domino (Zazie Beetz), whose superpower is luck (yep). We do get a surprise cameo, and there's even a shot of Deadpool with no pants ... and it's markedly unsexy.

{"review": "I enjoyed the first Deadpool film and I also enjoyed this one. Anyone who liked the first one, but didn't like this one is a bit perplexing seeing as how it contains the same humor as the first film. It is not as if this one is a huge departure that experiments and does things completely differently or something. No, we get the same Deadpool we got in the first film, only with some more action this time around, but still the same amount of gags. We also get Cable, X-Force, Colossus and a whole bunch of other crazy stuff!The story has Deadpool's lady friend from the first film being taken out by bad guys right from the get go leaving the super healing sort of superhero depressed and no longer wanting to live. Colossus tries to get Deadpool out of his funk and gets the crazed hero to join the X-men where he promptly gets himself arrested due to the fact he shoots someone during his first mission trying to get a mutant boy under control. The boy and Deadpool get sent to a prison and soon a mysterious warrior named Cable breaks into the prison to kill the boy. Deadpool makes it his mission to save the boy and forms X-force, but soon inadvertently frees not only the boy, but the Juggernaut as well from a prison convoy. Deadpool and Cable form an uneasy alliance and try to stop the boy before he kills and gets a taste for killing!The characters were great and I like how they did the Juggernaut in this movie. The first film showed that they could have made a proper looking Colossus and this film shows they could have made a Juggernaut that looks like Juggernaut in the X-men films. Not only that, they had Colossus and Juggernaut fight in this film! This is something I expected to happen in the third X-men movie, but it never happened. The Deadpool series just does a better job of making the characters look right and give us what we want. So, I enjoyed this film and I am sure there will most likely be another one. I enjoyed the humor and I really enjoyed the whole X-force portion of the film as the trailers I saw really had me fooled on how that would play out. Ryan Reynolds once again does a good job as Deadpool and I thought Josh Brolin did a decent job as Cable too. Kind of funny seeing him in this considering he was also the voice and motion actor for Thanos.

{"review": "\"Moonlight\" won the Oscar for Best Picture. While this clearly means that the folks at the Academy enjoyed and appreciated the film, this does not mean that the movie is one that most people would enjoy. Like \"The English Patient\", there seems to be a real disconnect between Hollywood and the viewing public...and the film isn't particularly enjoyable to watch...and at times, it's actually rather painful or dreadfully slow. Not a terrible film at all...but I don't understand all the hype.The film is about a young man named Chiron. The film is broken into three distinct phases. In phase one, Chiron is about 7 years-old. His life stinks. His mother is a crack addict and he's often beaten up by neighborhood gangs. The sole positive relationship is with an adult named Juan. Juan is an odd case...he's a drug dealer and a very tough guy. But he's also very tender and loving towards Chiron...and he doesn't seem to have any negative agenda...he just cares about the kid. Phase two is middle school. Chiron is still an exceptionally quiet young man...and he's still beaten up by gangs. He mostly tries to do his own thing...and Juan is no longer in his life. His only friend...well, that's a problematic relationship and I don't want to say more, as it might ruin the film. Phase three is adulthood and I am guessing Chiron is about 30. He now is very much like Juan...a drug dealer, but a very lonely one.The problem with this movie for me is that although the acting was exceptional and very realistic, the plot seemed almost inconsequential at times. Additionally, the movie's plot is quite vague. What's also vague is Chiron's sexuality. I read that the film is a very gay-positive film about a gay man...though this has been so de-emphasized I am shocked anyone really even cared. I wish they'd explored this is greater detail...and provided a lot less slow, uninteresting moments. Overall, a good film but certainly nothing that seems Oscar-worthy...and I still feel very confused by all this hubbub about \"Moonlight\".", "helpfulness": 0.4642857142857143}

Took me a while to see 'Moonlight', with the controversy it garnered when it was announced for the Best Picture Oscar and the amount of hate it's got here part of me was wary.Finally getting round to seeing 'Moonlight', it turned out that it was more than well worth the while and that the wariness was not needed. 'Moonlight' is not a perfect film and may not have been my personal pick for the Best Picture award (for me that was 'La La Land' though that is not a popular opinion it seems). Truly admired what it set out to do and found it a brave and powerful film, despite what the detractors say there is far more to 'Moonlight's' appeal than politics, sexuality and race (clearly trying to find conspiracy theories and reasons for why a film they dislike is loved by others, without taking into account that the film simply just connected to and resonated with those who liked it).'Moonlight' does end on an anti-climactic note, some of the last act is a bit rushed. A longer length would have helped as a result, it also would have helped make a couple of events in the first act a little clearer and not so choppy. It may not say much new, despite the ground-breaking concept on paper with the exploration of lives rarely seen on film, and doesn't always have subtlety. Then again it is tackling far from subtle themes and a heavy subject, so that sort of was going to be inevitable. However, 'Moonlight' is an exceptionally well made film. The cinematography and editing are some of the most eye-pleasing and best of that year, and can't find anything to fault the expertly handled direction. The music is cleverly mixed and has haunting power and fluidity. Regarding the writing, it is not perfect, at times as said a little heavy-handed and vague in parts, but it is thought-provoking and handles very ambitious, relevant, important themes with power, truth and (mostly) delicacy. The story makes the most of the three act structure, it's handled simply but not simplistically and also handled cleverly and with passion, honesty and intelligence. Found myself relating quite a lot to and being moved significantly by the story and found the film handled a heavy and sensitive subject matter with a lot of relevance and importance today more than admirably. Can't fault the acting, doing wonders with compellingly real characters and strongly defined character relationships (especially the central one). Much has been made of Maharshala Ali and Naomie Harris and deservedly with two of the best performances that year, Ali especially is extraordinary. It is easy though to overlook Alex R.

We first meet \"Little\" (Alex R. Hibbert) as a young kid who is discovered by a local drug dealer (Mahershala Ali) who tries to teach him some life lesson. We then meet him as a teenager (Ashton Sanders) where he is constantly being bullied while at the same time trying to learn his sexuality. Finally, in the third act, we meet him as an adult (Trevante Rhodes) and see how these earlier events have shaped his life.MOONLIGHT is a fantastic character study and I'd argue that it's one of the most interesting ever made. I'm not saying it's one of the greatest films ever made but at the same time I would argue that it's one of the best directed and acted movies that I've seen in a very long time and the end result is something rather special. Yes, we've seen these coming of age dramas for countless decades now but this one here still manages to come across rather fresh and original.What I loved most about the film were the performances by the three actors playing the same character at various stages of his life. A lot of movies try this and it's rare that all three are so believable in their roles that you really do feel as if you're watching one character throughout a period. All three actors really did seem to have studied each other or at least had such great direction where they were all acting the same way, with the same emotions and as the film went along you could see how the teenager was in the younger version and how these two versions played a major role on the adult.The performances here are simply wonderful with Hibbert, Sanders and Rhodes delivering some of the finest performances of the year. The amount of emotional and realism they bring this character is something really breathtaking to watch. Ali is the real standout though as he plays a man we meet and who at first we don't know anything about him. We slowly learn about his character but the presence Ali brings to the role is something truly excellent to watch and he delivers a knock out performance. Janelle Mon\u00e1e is also wonderful as his girlfriend as is Naomie Harris as the boy's mother.Director Barry Jenkins does an extremely wonderful job at keeping the film moving along.

{"review": "\"Moonlight\" is an American English-language film from 2016 and this is the movie that won Best Picture in a truly controversial presentation at the Oscars this year. It was probably a really really very close win over the suspected front-runner \"La La Land\", so it was somehow fitting the way it turned out. Anyway, this one here runs for 105 minutes approximately and it was written and directed by Barry Jenkins, who won an Oscar for his screenplay. This film is about one character and it is structured nicely into 3 parts during different times from this character's life. One is about him being a small boy, the next about him being a teenager and the final part is about him being a grown-up. Mahershala Ali only appears in the very first part and this was enough for him to win an Oscar. I think he was pretty good, but I am not sure if I'd call him Oscar worthy. Maybe a nomination would have sufficed. Naomie Harris was also nominated and she is in all three parts, even if only relatively short in the final section. And while the third and last part was probably my least favorite, I still want to give a thumbs-up to Trevante Rhodes who despite his strong physicality managed a very vulnerable performance and Andr\u00e9 Holland who did a great job next to Rhodes.So yeah, I think the middle part was probably the best (it certainly had the most touching moment namely when the central character gets hurt physically by the one he trusts the most, but it is also a powerful moment because he will stand up from now on), but also most likely the toughest to watch and there were 3-4 really shocking moments in there. One would also be when we hear what happened to Ali's character from the first sequence, even if it is just mentioned in one sentence. The film's strength is perhaps that it really feels very authentic and close to reality. You never have the impression you are watching actors here and also the story works out nicely. When the protagonist enters the world of crime and violence at the end of the second part, he is sucked in it very quickly and his physical transformation fits as well just like his profession. But at the very end (as we also see in the last shot), he is once again the little boy he was right at the beginning. All in all, I would say this is a solid movie and I don't mind it being nominated for Best Picture as it is really very good in its best moments, but the win may be a bit too much. I think it is roughly on par with the equally pretty good but not great \"La La Land\", maybe slightly inferior, but I am quite baffled the film won. Of course, the Academy adjusted their rules recently to help Black movies and actors after all this discrimination talk last year (with which I do not agree at all though), so this certainly helped \"Moonlight\" in getting the edge over \"La La Land\". But I am surprised because the subject is very specific and the Academy has not always reacted that warmly to gay-themed films, but also because \"Hidden Figures\" is a film with historic relevance and not just a personal story like this one here and I find it quite surprising it won Best Picture, also because it is also not a masterpiece from the technical perspective. But maybe they wanted to go for something else this year and honestly I am not too mad about \"Moonlight\" (pretty random name though with the color blue reference on one occasion in the film) winning, even if I would not say it is one of my very favorites from all the Best Picture nominees that year, let alone all Best Picture winners ever, or anywhere near my favorite 2016 films.

The first part (\"Little\") is heartbreaking, with the boy Chiron completely lost between the rejection of his crack addicted mother and the love of his new friends, a drug dealer and his girlfriend. The second part (\"Chiron\") is inferior but also attractive when Chiron is an adolescent and the problems and doubts he has to face in this difficult phase of life practically alone. Unfortunately, the third part (\"Black\"} is awful; Chiron has become a strong man (the biotypes totally different from his childhood and adolescence), drug dealer and gay. It is impressive how professional cinema critics love films where the characters are gays (remember \"Brokeback Mountain\", one of the most notorious) and the power they have to influence worldwide viewers with their opinions.

His mom uses crack. As a teen Little is now Chiron. His mom still uses crack. He stays with the girlfriend of the crack dealer. He is still bullied. As a man, his name is Black. Mom lives at a rehab center. He now wears a do-rag and sells crack. He lacks a personality. His sexual orientation is a hidden theme, the whole LGBT thing misses its mark.This was not a good Urban tale. It is not a drug film per se. I suppose if you are a Black Cuban growing up in the streets of Miami, with zero personality, you might relate to the film. I failed to relate to it as much as Janelle Mon\u00e1e who played Teresa minus any type of accent. When you say, \"Do you feel me?\" you do so with some attitude, not like some kid from Kansas. Mahershala Ali was convincing in his role and indeed the film was interesting when he was on the screen. He at least talked. Unfortunately the movie centered on a quiet moping kid/teen/man filled with self pity. If you want to make a film about a quiet man, give him a personality. I like Noel Clarke films better.BTW \"La La Land\" and \"Manchester by the Sea\" are the other two over hyped films.

You could be excused for thinking they tried to make up for it in 2017. Then again, that would not be fair to the movie at hand.A movie that really is going out there and is a movie that has a lot of heart, does go places you might not expect and is about what it means to be or rather become a man. In this case a man conflicted and torn because of his sexual preference. One that goes back to a couple of things, including one inciting incident that some might say has not much of a pay out at the end. But does it always have to have one? Also the \"not\" pay out works fine for the movie.The acting is really good and while the movie is raw this can work in favor of it for the viewer or against it.

{"review": "I've read a host of glowing reviews for this film, but at heart it's a story of a troubled young boy who grows into a troubled teenager, and finally into a troubled and conflicted adult. If one were to be honest, the film is a depressing indictment of growing up with a crack addicted mother and no father on hand to guide the youngster through the perils of the gang and drug culture prevalent in his neighborhood. In that regard, the character I admired most here was the local drug dealer Juan, ably portrayed by Mahershala Ali. But when I say admire, it's not because he was a fine, upstanding citizen, but someone who could draw on experiences from his own past to try and connect with Little (Alex Hibbert), and help him navigate the turmoil of his lousy family life and the torment of getting bullied at school.What didn't come across as realistic to me was Little's own concept of being gay. I know kids grow up fast these days, but how does a nine or ten year old confront their own sexuality at that age. I guess this is where my fuddy-duddy way of thinking enters the picture, at that age I didn't think in terms of liking other boys or girls in that way. But then again, one wasn't inundated with the kind of explicit material in the Fifties the way kids growing up today are, whether inadvertently or on purpose.With the story taking significant jumps in time, the viewer has to fill in a lot of blanks on your own. The chapter dealing with Chiron's (Ashton Sanders) taking a chair to the bully kid left me looking for a resolution to the assault charge he would inevitably have to deal with. Because the picture doesn't deal with the aftermath, it almost feels like Chiron got away with it, except for being hauled off by the cops. I would like to have known the outcome of that event.When \"Brokeback Mountain\" broke new ground in the film industry, I thought it dealt with the subject of homosexuality in a generally mature way without a lot of sensationalism. It had it's one scene, and this film does too, and for many the discomfort level will be palpable. To my mind, that's when Chiron became a real victim of his environment, unable to confront his own feelings and urges, with the rest of his life heading toward one of conflicted unhappiness. As the adult Black (Trevante Rhodes), that pain and sorrow emerges when he sees his former friend Kevin (Andre Holland) and ruefully asks, \"Why did you call me?\"", "helpfulness": 0.3333333333333333}

{"review": "I'm always interested during Awards Season to see the films with the most nominations in the three big ceremonies, this was one of those films getting the most attention, and one I was looking forward to watching the most, because of its critical acclaim. Basically it tells the story of Chiron from childhood to adulthood, in three parts of his life, as a young adolescence, as a pubescent teenager, and as a man. i. Little - Chiron, nicknamed Little (Alex R. Hibbert), is a shy and withdrawn child. He is found hiding from bullies by crack cocaine dealer Juan (Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Mahershala Ali), with his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Mon\u00e1e) they help Chiron to open up. Chiron lives with his emotionally abusive mother Paula (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Naomie Harris), but Chiron finds companionship with school friend Kevin (Jaden Piner), and he continues to see Juan, who teaches him to swim and gives him advice. Juan catches Paula smoking crack, he is angry at her using it, but she retaliates reminding him that he sells it, she takes her anger out on Chiron. The next day, Chiron visits Juan and Teresa, telling how he hates his mother, he asks a question regarding his sexuality, and also about drugs, Juan admits he sells drugs, Chiron leaves, Juan hangs his dead in shame. ii. Chiron - Now a teenager, Chiron (Ashton Sanders) experiences frequent bullying, especially from Terrel (Patrick Decile), and he remains close to Kevin (Jharrel Jerome). Paula is now addicted to crack, prostitutes herself and begs Chiron for money, which is given to him by Teresa, who he continues to visit, Juan is dead. One night, Chiron and Kevin stop at the beach near his house to smoke a blunt, they discuss their life ambitions and why Kevin gives Chiron the nickname \"Black\", in a charged moment they share a kiss, and Kevin gives Chiron a handjob. The next day, Kevin is forced by Terrel to beat up Chiron, until the bullies are chased away by security, Chiron does not reveal the identity of the attackers to a social worker, believing it won't solve anything. The following day, Chiron angrily attacks Terrel, smashing a chair on his back, he is subsequently arrested, he glares at Kevin as he is taken away in the police car. iii. Black - Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) is now a hardened adult, he is a drug dealer going by the name \"Black\". Having left juvenile hall and moved up since starting dealing, he now lives outside Atlanta, in a similar condition to what Juan did. Chiron is constantly called by Paula who wants him to visit, then he is surprised by a call from Kevin (Andr\u00e9 Holland), who is working in Miami, he apologises for his actions as a teenager, and hopes Chiron will visit. The following day, Chiron visits his mother, she is now living in a drug treatment facility and regrets her past behaviour, they have a tense exchange, but Chiron forgives Paula. Chiron travels to Miami to reunite with Kevin, who is a server and cook in a restaurant, Chiron is reluctant to let Kevin speak or drink with him. They both head to Kevin's home, Kevin questions if things could have been different, but is happy with his life, Chiron admits Kevin is the only person he has been intimate with, they physically reconcile and tenderly embrace. The final shot of the film sees young Chiron playing in the ocean in the moonlight. The three actors playing the same character in the three stages, who just about look similar, are each compelling, Hibbert as the quiet boy, Sanders as the persecuted teen, and Rhodes as the hardened but emotionally scarred adult, Ali is brilliant as the drug dealer who becomes a tender father figure to the boy, and Harris is fantastic as the crack-addict mother. It is a beautiful film, it is so simple in its format, but equally as clever, it tackles the subjects of youth, poverty, sexuality, identity, drug use and some racism truthfully and brilliantly, the use of colour throughout is marvellous vivid, the music is wonderful, and it is intimately moving, it is just an extraordinary film, I would highly recommend it, a masterpiece drama. It won the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year (after the \"envelopegate\" cock up where La La Land was wrongly announced as the winner) and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Director for Barry Jenkins, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Music, Original Score for Nicholas Britell, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film and Best Original Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Original Score.

{"review": "Mahershala Ali gives a thoughtful, exquisite performance as a generally wise and kind-hearted drug dealer in Miami who takes a shine to a bullied black youngster in his neighborhood, one with no friends and a mother on crack. Unfortunately, the overreaching screenplay by director Barry Jenkins, from Tarell Alvin McCraney's original story, eliminates Ali's Juan from the narrative in its second chapter, wherein the frightened youngster has become a withdrawn teenager. It's understandable that Jenkins would choose to focus on the younger person's journey--the need for a dramatic story arc (i.e., the kind of thing they teach in screen writing classes)--but, as a teenager, the protagonist Chiron, still fighting the childhood nickname \"Little,\" hasn't progressed as a character to the point of retaining our sympathy (he's actually been stripped of character). As a director, Jenkins observes the quiet, wide-eyed boy with compassion, but he doesn't allow the teenage Chiron any personal growth (in his understated but direct way, Juan hopes to instill some of his philosophy in the child, which isn't rebuffed but neither is it utilized). The film's weakest link is Chiron's relationship to his mother (Oscar-nominated Naomie Harris), who comes on like a harried working mom but is soon revealed to be an irresponsible junkie (Harris is the Hollywood version of an addict: pearly-white teeth, clear skin and even clearer eyes). Movies about bullied people ask a lot from their audience; we squirm while they're being victimized, and we wait in frustration for them to defend themselves. When Chiron finally has had enough and fights back, he's not using the advice he's been given (what we've been privy to). Instead, Jenkins has him snap, lash out. Maybe this is realistic behavior, but it doesn't lend itself to a believable third act (which I felt was a little coy). Jenkins and his team probably felt (or, at least, hoped) they were treading new ground in their final act--with drama portrayed 'from the heart' and so on--but \"Moonlight\", though most certainly a noble film, doesn't hang together as a convincing portrait of one man's life. I kept wondering what happened to Ali; his Juan is the only person on-screen who seems to live outside the constricted dialogue. **1/2 from ****", "helpfulness": 0.45}

{"review": "Barry Jenkins is a fascinating storyteller, and in large part because of how he goes about being fascinated by his subject, how his camera roams at times, and at others when he knows to cut between his subjects. But most of all, he is a truly magnificent filmmaker because of how he so deftly finds universal themes from a place and people that is somewhat specific. This is a story about a boy who grows into a man - I'm tempted to call it the 'better, bigger, blacker-er Boyhood', though that's not totally the case - but he is also a boy growing up in a largely black, Southern, lower (middle?) class neighborhood, where it seems drugs are everywhere (including his own mother who is an addict) and no one can be \"soft\". And if you're gay, a \"f***ot?\" Watch out.I grew up in a town and in the public school system where it was predominantly black and brown and Hispanic, and it seemed like even having the slightest effeminate tendencies would make that one a subject for immediate ridicule (I was even picked on and I was pretty sure from a young age I wasn't gay, but was picked on so much for a moment almost though I was, it was that persistent). It may not be so different for white small towns or big cities or who knows what, but it's especially difficult for African-American men to come out. And yet if Moonlight was only about the gay issue then it would be interesting but not overly compelling. I think what Jenkins and his actors are communicating so strongly is being *so* isolated and without any options that it's about one's overall identity. Sex and attraction is a large component, but simply knowing who one is is a major struggle.Jenkins has some very big, emotional scenes in this film, which is told in three parts, in large part coming from the dynamic between the boy, called \"Little\" but actual named Chiron, and his mother (Naomie Harries, I mean, god damn she is amazing in this). However, the predominant mood here is one of subtlety, of a vision that is fairly ambitious but is more about the interior life of his protagonist, this boy having to navigate how he should be in a society that leaves little options to get out and be something more than a drug dealer or the like (eventually, both he and another friend character, Kevin, wind up in jail in-between parts 2 and 3. This can be a difficult way to make someone interesting, but there's so much truth from these young actors, especially the boy playing Chrion in middle-school age, that your heart pours out even more because of the restraint, because of the shyness that is hiding back an entire interior life that's more than what we can see: one of pain and want.The way Jenkins shoots everything gives characters and places an extra texture, how he'll show two people by a beach at night becoming closer together naturally over minutes that feel pregnant with meaning. To use the word 'sensitively drawn and performed' may be a clich\u00e9, but sensitive is the only way I can think to describe it. This isn't to say it's melodramatic, far from it; when we get the bullies that come at Chiron, it feels raw and immediate, like something could pop and violence could erupt at any moment. Sometimes, it seems, it does. A small piece of advice is given to the boy by the drug dealing father-figure (no one else in his life fills that role, and he doesn't realize at first he is a dealer): no one can tell you who you are, you have to figure that out for yourself.When I first got out of the theater at the end, I was wondering if the ending was slightly abrupt, that things come to a conclusion somewhat not so much fast but there's something else. I think writing this review now, I was more touched and moved by the thought of 'I now want to see where this story goes, what happens now that Chrion has had this emotional breakthrough.' It's as subtle as many moments in this film, but there's a poetic side to it that is potent and you can almost touch it that it's so powerful. Moonlight is profound because it doesn't force anything, it lets those moments where things aren't said speak out loud, when characters share looks or someone looks away while another looks straight on at another person, or the movement of boys with one another, and you can fill in the gaps for yourself. It's also a look at the black experience that is both specific to that world but goes beyond that: if you've ever not known who you are in your life, if you've felt lost or abused or abandoned, this is a film for you.", "helpfulness": 0.5245901639344263}

{"review": "Altogether a memorable, solidly made film, the 2017 Oscar winning Best Picture \"Moonlight\" has little to distinguish it from the other nominees in the same category of Best Picture aside from its LGBQT content. Despite strong performances by a uniformly gifted cast, director Barry Jenkins' second feature-length film (everything else has been classified as a 'short') looks and sounds familiar. We have another African-American drama high school set in the inner city (Liberty City) of the thriving metropolis of Miami, Florida, and the underdog protagonist Chiron is the product of a broken home who suffers mercilessly at the hand of intimidating bullies. Chiron's mother is just as heartless as the school bullies who harass him without let-up. Predictably, the moment he retaliates against his chief adversary Terrell (newcomer Patrick Decile), our protagonist finds himself clapped into handcuffs and packed off to prison. Sometimes, stories like this appall me, because the lead character-Chiron (variously played at different ages by Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, and eventually Trevante Rhodes), has found life a challenge from the start and ordeal in progress. To say that Chiron has been treated unfairly is an understatement. Ironically, prison seems to be a break for him because it regenerates him into a strong, intelligent, perceptive man. Meantime, Chiron's single-mother Paula (beautifully played by a dolled-down Naomie Harris of \"Spectre\") is addicted to crack and spends time with a variety of men, often driving Chiron away from home to fend for himself. Briefly, Chiron finds a father figure in a Cuban dope dealer, Juan (Mahershala Ali of \"Hidden Figures\"), who takes him in with his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Mon\u00e1e of \"Hidden Figures\") and raises him during the moments that he has with him. For example, Juan advises Chiron to never sit with his back to a door because he won't know who is sneaking up behind him. Unfortunately, Chiron is as clueless about this as he is about life in general. He knows that the other kids at school ridicule him and want to use him as a punching bag. Eventually, one truculent student Terrel (newcomer Patrick Decile) compels Chiron's best friend in high school, Kevin (Jharrel Jerome) to unload on him in the playground, knocking him down three times while everybody else watches but nobody says anything. What bothers Chiron the most is the word 'faggot,' and Juan tells him frankly what it means. \"A faggot is... a word used to make gay people feel bad,\" Juan explains. Nevertheless, Juan adds, \"You can be gay, but you don't have to let nobody call you a faggot.\" Eventually, a hopelessly confused Chiron has his first sexual encounter with an apparently heterosexual friend, Kevin (Jharrel Jerome) and later feels betrayed when Kevin slugs him thrice at Terrel's insistence. \"Moonlight\" occurs in three phases of Chiron life. First, he is an adolescent dealing with his hateful mother. Second, he is a high school student struggling for help. Third, he is a grown man with a body like Hercules. For the sake of closure, Jenkins doesn't tell us what happened to Terrel. We see him sprawled in the floor of the classroom after Chiron has shattered a chair across his back. The moment that Chiron resorts to physical violence to attack Terrel was one of the more liberating moments in \"Moonlight.\" Despite everything that Chiron suffers through from homeless to prison, he emerges as a self-aware individual who doesn't behave like a domino pushing others around because he had been pushed around.\"Moonlight\" is a good film, but it is not a great film. The Best Picture Oscar \"Moonlight\" took home virtually guarantees that this social melodrama will never be forgotten. Academy had shunned African-Americans in previous years. Mahershala Ali deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his quiet, restrained performance. The third Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay by Barry Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney, based on his previously unpublished play \"In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue\" is deserved, too. According to reports, Jenkins and McCraney both attended the same schools in Liberty City, but they were not friends at the time. Although the film concerns controversial subject matter, Jenkins never shows any overt sexual scenes with nudity, apart from a kiss between Kevin and Chiron and the groans of orgasm when they sit together.", "helpfulness": 0.25}

All this time he has one true friend - Kevin - and the relationship between Chiron and Kevin ultimately forms the spine of the story.Good drama about growing up, the relationships we form and how these are carried over into adult life.

More character and relationship details were needed. A slower progression was in order - the first two periods of Chiron's life seems rushed and we are just fed the story without having time to contemplate on it.

{"review": "\"Moonlight\" may very well be a breath of fresh air to others who are tired to death of our culture's obsession with labeling and categorizing everything in an attempt to understand it. If it can't be easily categorized, it's either frightening and something to be opposed to, or it's abnormal and therefore something to be marginalized.The main conflict at the heart of \"Moonlight,\" a beautiful movie about a young black man's coming of age in poor and drug-afflicted Miami, is our protagonist's inability to define himself in terms that his environment will allow. He doesn't fit into any of the categories available to him, so he sets out to force himself into one that seems like the best option. His name is Chiron, and the movie shows him to us at three stages of his life, portrayed by three different but wonderful actors. As a little boy, he struggles with loneliness and neglect thanks to a crack-addicted mom (played by Naomie Harris) and takes to the first person who offers to be a father figure to him. In a Dickensian twist, this person happens to be a drug dealer who nevertheless offers him sympathy and understanding not to be found anywhere else. The middle section depicts Chiron as a young man navigating his emerging homosexuality and the high school bullying that goes along with it. In the film's final and most breathtaking sequence, we follow Chiron as a man in his twenties to a reunion with a high school friend who gave him his first gay experience and whom he's never been able to completely move on from. This entire sequence is directed, written, and acted with utmost delicacy.I can't think of a movie in recent memory that puts loneliness and anguish on screen more effectively than \"Moonlight.\" It's a movie that asks us to see life from the perspective of a very specific individual but then draws universal conclusions from it that makes the superficial differences between him and the viewer (I'm not black, I'm not gay, I didn't grow up in a poor urban environment) melt away until you feel deep compassion and sympathy for a fellow human being who is doing what we all are -- navigating the complexities of living on this world and making the best of it we can.Grade: A", "helpfulness": 0.5515463917525774}

{"review": "Having just gotten back from seeing 'La La Land', with a rare day off music college, it came to me that it was one of the best new release/first viewings for me in a while.Very few films in recent memory has left me leave the cinema with my heart properly warmed, a beaming smile on my face, tears in my eyes, feeling uplifted and properly moved. 'La La Land' however has managed that feat. Would also go further to say that it is one of the best modern film musicals after Disney's Renaissance period in the 90s, and very much a modern classic. Am not surprised at all its award wins and nominations (including being a record breaker at the Golden Globes), and if it does well at the Oscars as well there will be no complaints from me.'La La Land' clicked with me most likely because of my love for golden age Hollywood, musicals (a somewhat maligned genre these days, but while there are a fair share of not particularly good ones there are a bigger number of great ones and even masterpieces), and how it fondly reminded me of what makes me love them so much. Also because of being able to relate to its themes and conflicts, due to being there myself. The talent was also appetising, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, directed by 'Whiplash's' Damien Chazelle and featuring cameo support from JK Simmons (who coincidentally won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for 'Whiplash), John Legend and Rosemarie DeWitt.It was just sheer joy to see a film with so much potential deliver on that potential and even more so, having seen a lot of stuff recently film and TV that wasted their potential it was refreshing to see a film actually delivering on it.Visually, 'La La Land' is a gorgeous-looking film, with lots of vibrant colour that leap out at you from the screen while not having too much of a dizzying effect and cinematography that's not just a dream to behold but inventively done without falling into self-indulgent territory. The music and songs may induce, and has induced, mixed reactions, count me in as somebody who found the songs infectious, emotion-filled and with enough to make one top-tap and hum along.The musical numbers are winningly choreographed too with non-stop exuberance. The opening number is especially true to this. The script is warm, funny, affectionate and poignant, and also with an honesty. It's not a complex script, nor did it need to be, and neither does it make the mistake of being too simple. The story is admittedly slight in places, then again so were the stories of even the best golden age musicals and they still managed to be classics because of how everything else was executed and because of the atmosphere.Something that is true with 'La La Land', a film where anybody can relate to its themes. Even more special though is that not only does it pay tribute to musicals and films of the golden age (especially those with MGM), with their bold colour, exuberant marriage of music and dance, it also has a winsomeness and melancholic nature seen in films like 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg' yet does it in a way that will appeal hugely to modern audiences. Loved that the two leads' relationship and chemistry was much more complex than the love-at-first-sight sort (far from it, more antagonists turned lovers) with a meet cute first encounter (again also not a case).Chazelle's direction shows someone with a sheer love for film and film-making, more than evident in execution that is affectionate and full-of-life rather than self-indulgent. The chemistry between the two leads and their performances would need to be good to make the film work. No worries there. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone look so natural and at ease together, nothing looks false and it is easy to root for them and their conflicts.Both of them give terrific performances, performances so good that less than great singing was immediately forgotten about. Especially Stone who has never been better in a performance of great expressivity and nuance, so many emotions such as vulnerability, strength, cheekiness, charm and buoyancy with never a hint of a heavy-handed touch. Gosling matches her, if not quite as good, showing a very charismatic presence and an effortless twinkling charm. All the support, although basically cameos, registers memorably.All in all, a dream come true and totally banishes any blues and daily troubles away. 10/10 Bethany Cox", "helpfulness": 0.6164383561643836}
{"review": "Tis said that a really great picture is one where even the small character parts truly stand out. Gone With The Wind boasts not just its four memorable leads, but a whole flock of memorable characters who stand out. Dr. Meade by Harry Davenport and his wife Julia Meade by Jane Darwell are two examples and there are many more.La La Land stands short of real greatness in that it only concentrates on its two leads with the rest of the characters well into the background. But the two leads Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone being nominated for Best Actor and Actress and Stone taking home the Oscar gold.La La Land is a salute to those old time backstage musicals in an age when movies just don't have the talented musical performers to do those films any more. Emma Stone had some nice notes, but Gosling did his singing in the tradition of Rex Harrison who as I recall won Oscar and Tony for being Henry Higgins with talk/sing role.Gosling is a musician, a jazz pianist in the tradition of Earl Hines and Count Basie and he wants to bring back jazz. He truly hates contemporary music and the fact he has to play keyboard in a rock band rather than do what those aforementioned gentlemen did. I really identified with Gosling, in my own life I'm posting music with Bing and Frank and their contemporaries on Facebook and care not if no one else listens but me.Stone just wants the world to notice her talent and in that cruel and heartless world that can be show business getting noticed about 3/4 of the battle. She does do a reckless move that would and could dishearten anyone so the world will notice what she has to offer.Besides Stone winning Best Actress and young Damian Chazelle for Best Director, La La Land won 6 others and several more nominations like Gosling's. The music is fine though I wish we had people like Frank Sinatra or a Gene Kelly to perform this stuff now.La La Land is a wonderful film that falls a tad short on greatness.", "helpfulness": 0.46153846153846156}

The film is a homage to Hollywood and everything that Hollywood used to produce. This, of course, is a musical so the film pays respect to the type of film that MGM and Hollywood was pumping out in the 1950s. Is the film worthy of all the praise it's getting? Calling a film overrated is something that will strike up an argument on any message board but while I don't think the film was that great, there's no question that it's an extremely charming film with two great performances.I will start off with what I didn't love about the film. One was the opening dance number, which was impressive in regards to how it was shot but at the same time I must admit that it really didn't pull me into the film. I'd also say that I didn't love any of the songs in the picture. A couple were nice but I really didn't walk out of the theater singing any of them. Finally, I did feel that the film went on a bit too long and would have benefited from about ten-minutes being cut out.With all of that out of the way, there was still a lot of stuff here that I really enjoyed but there's no question that the greatest thing were the two leads. Gosling and Stone were so great and so wonderfully charming together that you couldn't help but fall in love with their characters and want to see them succeed. I really thought both of them did a terrific job in their acting, their dancing and their singing and you can honestly say that they were among the most entertaining couples from recent memory. They really get to shine with the comedy, the romance and the drama and they really pack a great punch.I also really loved the Jazz music in the picture. The music is certainly something wonderful and it just perfectly builds up the story and delivers the goods. The film also benefits from some wonderful costume and production design with brilliant uses of colors that just leap off the screen. As I said, the film is a homage to Hollywood and there's some great dialogue about older movies, older stars and of course Jazz musicians.It's easy to see why people and especially Hollywood are in love with LA LA LAND. It's a great throwback to the type of romantic comedies and musicals that were made in a different era. I'm sure many young people were seeing this type of film for the first time.

It's an interesting experiment, and as somebody who is unashamedly old-fashioned, I was looking forward to see how it turned out. The end result is less than impressive, however. The film has a generic digital look and at times feels like GLEE the movie, with overhearsed dance sequences and generic tunes; only one repeated refrain makes the viewer feel anything.

The complaints of clich\u00e9, hokey, and less than epic singing and dancing from the leads are all fitting to some extend. The problem is that those complaining are actually missing the point. Firstly, Stone and Gosling are perfect cast with their try-hard, glee-loving, pure-loveliness personalities. They are not the best singers or dancers. They are the high school drama kids who made it big. They are drama geeks and that's exactly what this movie is about. It's drama geek heaven. It revels in the old Hollywood clich\u00e9s.

{"review": "\"La La Land\" is an American movie from 2016 and little needs to be said about the cast and production here. It runs for slightly over 2 hours and is the most recent work by writer and director Damien Chazelle. The two leads are Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Chazelle won an Oscar for his direction, while Stone took home glory for her performance. The movie itself probably lost as close as you could imagine in the Best Picture category. Now about the film: Many people say that this movie is the return of old Hollywood musicals and this is partially true. While the film is set in the 21st century, the music, costumes and the entire atmosphere have something that feels extremely retro all the time. Lets start with the music. It won Oscar for Song and Score and it is probably deserving. The two Oscar-nominated songs in the right context (the winner as a duet) work wonderfully and are among the parts that can be considered heart and soul of the film. But the real heart and soul here is Emma Stone's performance. She has excellent material to work with and still manages to elevate it on so many occasions. I believe that she was the perfect choice for the character here, in the lighter as well as heavier moments and honestly, there were certainly more of the latter. This is much more a drama than a comedy. As for Gosling, I am not so impressed. First of all, it needs to be said that he did not have the material as good as Stone's. We find out nothing (or not much) about his background really, about his family life, about his past and it's clear from start to finish that he will always play second fiddle to his co-lead. I may be a bit biased as I was never big on Gosling, but in terms of acting and face expressions I am not impressed by him in here either. He may not have great material to work with, but he also does not elevate it and ultimately one thing that this film may have needed for making an even bigger impact would have been a better male lead. It's pretty ridiculous they gave him a Golden Globe for that.Now on a more positive note, Hurwitz' music was good for the most part. I already talked about the two most important songs, but I also liked the very first song of the film, maybe because I just like choir-like ensemble performances. As for the film itself, Chazelle did a pretty good job overall, especially if you take his age into consideration. It's a really impressive feat for somebody around the age of 30. The way he includes parallels is as smart as simple. It is effective nonetheless though and that's all that counts. One example would be the two scenes of a star entering the bar. Another would be the honking references. Another would be the \"what if\" sequence at the end. Another would be the elaboration on one partner sacrificing his dreams for the other, the one when Mia is supposed to follow her boyfriend who is really successful with his band. The other would be again the \"what if\" sequence at the end. And there are many more moments like this. You will recognize them if you see them. I also think this was a much more beautiful film visually than I expected it to be. No surprise and not undeserving that it won an Oscar for the cinematography.Lastly, let me give you a parallel too, namely between this film and Whiplash, Chazelle's previous successful Oscar-winning work. I am not talking about the brief inclusion of J.K. Simmons here or about the fact that Chazelle is apparently right now the very best filmmaker on the planet when it comes to music-themed movies. I want to talk about love. The way he depicts it in both films, namely as a wonderful state that however becomes very fragile in the face of career development and a status that even needs to be sacrificed for individual happiness makes me wonder if I would categorize this movie as romance. Sure there are lines that somewhat make up for it like when they say they will always love each other, but overall, it's a pretty sober state of things when you see it in the grand scheme, here and in \"Whiplash\". Right/Wrong place, right/wrong time (i.e. coincidence) play a major role here and the message that you should never let your romantic feeling limit you in any way is absolute core for Chazelle apparently. And happiness is still happening eventually and there are no hard feelings as we learn from the final smile that may have ended their relationship once and for all and they will probably never see each other again afterward. And one final note, on why I believe that so many people relate to this movie. And this is one that has nothing to do with the subject of music at all. Stone's character could have been in any profession as we see a character fighting hard for her (professional) success and we all can relate to her and her struggles because even in completely different professions, we probably had been in exactly the same situation at some point. Now for a very last comment, let me ask you the question what you were thinking after Mia's one-person performance. Did you think her career was over after the mean comments? Then this tells you a lesson to care less what people think (about you or whatever) and let only your own opinion be the determining factor. Now your persuasion should be to watch \"La La Land\" as it is without a doubt one of the better films of 2016 and maybe even the best music film in recent time, even if I personally would not rank it anywhere near the vastly superior \"Whiplash\" or \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\".", "helpfulness": 0.3125}
{"review": "Damien Chazelle whose father is French has made a Gallic tinged song and dance musical set in Los Angeles. In some ways it is a modern variant of Singin in the Rain but without the overt optimism which modern life does not have. The film has wowed the critics at the awards season but I think like the film 'The Artist' it might not stand up to scrutiny a few years later.This is a bittersweet love story between Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a jazz pianist passionate about the golden age of jazz and wanting to open his own club to play the type of jazz he wants before it really does go to obscurity. He keeps on bumping into Mia (Emma Stone) an aspiring actress who works in a coffee shop on the Warner Bros studio lot and goes to endless auditions looking for that big break but only to find disinterested casting agents.Both of them are looking for that big break but find each other slowly at first, but love may not be enough when these people also crave success. Sebastian finds it first, recording and touring with a successful group which puts their relationship under a strain.Director Damien Chazelle dazzles with a big opening musical number in a traffic jam on the highway but the energy of that number cannot be sustained. Like many modern musicals these days the songs are anaemic and unmemorable not helped with some of the jazz numbers. The film is right, much of the audience will be put off by the jazz music.The dance numbers between the pair is meant to be easy going than emulate Fred n Ginger and in some ways it works. Chazelle as in in his previous film Whiplash has found a rhythm to his film. It has a sentiment that individual pursuit for your dreams may be the price worth paying for true love. The story although at times tender as well as abrasive is not strong enough and the film really did feel stretched.", "helpfulness": 0.5}

In the awards time of year it is particularly hard since everyone is talking up films as much as possible, and lots of 'proper' films come out around then in order to qualify. Last year was no different and La La Land was one of the films that we were all told was a big contender and would surely merit its place surrounded by the great films that had gone before it. Years of disappointment has told me not to get caught up in the hype but just catch things later when they are cheaper and have lost their promotion. With La La Land, that time was now, but the distance has actually only hurt it.More on that in a minute. Generally speaking, La La Land is perfectly fine. It is a pleasant film that has charm and good grace mostly. It wallows in an image of Hollywood that doesn't exist, and fills its delivery with nostalgia and simplification; it is easy to see why it was so popular with those successfully in the industry, and those all hoping that their big break is just around the corner. As a story there is not much too it. The delivery isn't as charming as it needed to be; the musical numbers after that first great one are mostly only okay - they try hard, but they are only okay. The characters are thin, although they benefit from good performances - mostly from Stone, who I really enjoyed. It is nothing special, but it works in a sort of cheerful fantasy way.One year on though, and the #MeToo movement and associated revelations cast a different light on a young woman in Hollywood trying to get ahead. La La Land was a bit smug and fantastical before this, but after it has an air of denial to it too - unintended of course and not the film's fault, but it is there nonetheless, and the cheerful \"have a dream and get your break\" theme stands out badly.

{"review": "I'm quickly coming to the conclusion that this year's Academy Award nominations for Best Picture will be one of the weakest ones in recent memory. This film is the third one I've seen among likely nominees, the others being \"Manchester by the Sea\" and \"Arrival\". Taking nothing away from this film's principals, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, I couldn't help thinking that this is the kind of picture I might have gotten a kick out of if I was still in high school. It seems geared to adolescent fans of musical drama and Academy folks who will be enthralled by the doomed romance aspects of the story, leaving a wide range of movie goers in between for whom real life has a lot more to it than dancing away one's road rage on a jammed freeway.With that, I don't have too much of a problem with the production aspects of the movie. It's bright and colorful and there's some gorgeous cinematography at work but it doesn't seem enough. I'd have to say that Emma Stone does a remarkable job with the range of emotions she's expected to convey; I'm actually a sucker for anyone who can cry at the drop of a dime the way she does here any number of times. Ryan Gosling is not quite her match in that regard, but still pretty competent in his role as the conflicted jazz man. Considering they aren't professional dancers, the scenes calling for them to strut their stuff are done quite well.I thought as well that the frequent Griffith Observatory scenes were overdone. Sebastian (Gosling) and Mia (Stone) weren't rebels without a cause; they had inspired goals in mind that they pursued with diligence and patience. The ill fated aspect of their romance at the heart of the story will bring a tear to the eye of many viewers, but within the context of the story it felt contrived and telegraphed long before the break up actually occurred.With that, the film stands at number twenty four on IMDb's list of all time rated movies as I write this, right between \"The Silence of the Lambs\" and \"It's a Wonderful Life\". Can anyone explain that? It will almost certainly adjust downward as time goes by, but it's personally frustrating for me to see brand new releases accorded the same stature as films that have stood the test of time over decades.One bright spot though - the scene with Miles Anderson as the photographer in that 'bite the lip' segment - that was hilarious.", "helpfulness": 0.14285714285714285}

Basically in Los Angeles, California, on-studio barista and aspiring actress Mia (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Emma Stone) and jazz pianist Sebastian (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Ryan Gosling) are caught in traffic on a crowded highway, they have a moment of road rage. Despite her best efforts, Mia has a poor audition, that night she is taken out by her roommates to a lavish Hollywood Hills party, after which she finds her car has been towed away and is forced to take the long walk back. Sebastian is playing piano for a gig in a restaurant, he slips into passionate jazz improvisation, despite being warned by the owner Bill (J.K.

Months later, Mia and Sebastian cross paths when he is playing with a band at a party, he is a part of a 1980s pop cover band, after the gig they walk together to find their cars, and expressing the waste of a good evening with each other, but there is clearly chemistry between them. Mia takes Sebastian on a walk around the movie lot, explaining her passion for acting, and Sebastian takes Mia to a jazz club, describing his love for the music that may be dying out, and explaining his passion to open a club, they warm to each other. Mia has a commitment with her current boyfriend, she forgot this when accepting an invite from Sebastian to a screening of Rebel Without a Cause, but she leaves to join Sebastian, as the film begins, the two conclude their evening with a romantic dance at the Griffith Observatory. Mia has more failed auditions, following Sebastian's suggestion she decides to write a personal single-actress play, while Sebastian begins to perform regularly at the jazz club, the two also move in together. Sebastian's high school classmate Keith (John Legend) invites him to be the keyboardist in his jazz band, this is an offer for steady income, Sebastian is daunted by the pop- oriented style of the band, but overhearing a conversation by Mia to her mother about his career, he signs with them, and Mia knows his heart is not fully into the music being made. The band are on their first tour, Mia confronts Sebastian about his future and goals, he responds saying that she wanted him to have a steady career, then accuses her that she loved him when he was unsuccessful, Mia leaves insulted. Sebastian fails to show up for the opening night of Mia's solo play, due to a photo shoot he forgot about, only a few people attend, Mia is dejected overhearing dismissive comments from audience members, so she leaves Los Angeles and moves back to Boulder City, Nevada. One day, Sebastian receives a call from a casting agent who was watching Mia's play, Mia has been invited to a film audition, Sebastian drives to Boulder City and persuades Mia to return, she is simply asked to tell a story for the audition, she tells an emotional story about her aunt who inspired her to pursue acting. Sebastian is confident that the audition went well for Mia, he asserts that she must devote herself wholeheartedly to the opportunity she has been given, they profess they will always love each other, but they face an uncertain future. Five years later, Mia is a famous actress and married to David (Tom Everett Scott) and they have a daughter, one night they stumble into a jazz club, Mia notices the name \"Seb's\", she realises Sebastian has finally opened his own club, he is playing piano and spots her in the audience, looking unsettled and regretful. This prompts an extended dream sequence, the two imagine what might have been had their relationship worked out perfectly, while their love theme plays, when the dream ends Mia leaves with her husband, before walking out Sebastian and Mia look at each other with a knowing look and smile, they are happy they have achieved their dreams.

{"review": "One can say many things about writer-director Damien Chazelle's \"La La Land\" and, indeed, the critics' plaudits and accolades have already infiltrated our national consciousness: it's a valentine to movie musicals; it's a musical for people who don't like musicals; it's a feel-good movie for all audiences; it's a tonic for our national malaise. The story--separated into seasonal chapters--is pretty basic: Emma Stone is a barista on the Warner Bros. movie lot who aspires to be an actress but can't get passed the audition phase; Ryan Gosling is a jazz pianist who longs to play his own compositions. They encourage each other to follow their dreams, which doesn't necessarily mean taking the financially lucrative road (although having money in the bank would certainly be an incentive for a better future, even if the 'artistic value' isn't there yet). Yes, Chazelle is in love with movies--he steals enough from the motion picture past to tell us that--and, certainly, the opening musical number on a jammed Los Angeles freeway is full of contagious acrobatic joy and celebration. The trouble is, these two young people aren't willing to compromise (perhaps that would be allowing for too much realism). Chazelle attempts to show us that success doesn't always lead to happiness, yet his protagonists don't see the big picture; starry-eyed, they want instant gratification through artistic expression. The dancing is polished (too polished, I thought) and the early numbers (such as one with Stone and her girlfriends) have a sprightly quality that is old-fashioned in concept and charmingly lacking in pretension. Still, the hardships of a romantic relationship pulled in different directions isn't all that interesting here, mainly because Gosling and Stone seem so charmed and picture-perfect. She trembles with a beginner's desperation during her auditions and is convincingly unhappy when her one-woman show doesn't pan out, but watching her out to dinner with an affluent date and his friends reveals nothing more than a princess eager to try another throne. Gosling has a moment or two when he's able to give us a natural response to a line or situation, but his concern for Stone seldom registers. The brightly-painted film is reaching for a certain height--a plastic paradise, a movie heaven--that will flood us with good feelings in its attempt and break our hearts with its climax. However, if you are not invested in these characters by the midway point, it will all seem like a glossy charade. ** from ****", "helpfulness": 0.4810126582278481}
{"review": "Disclaimer: I like musicals, of all kinds, so I was predisposed to like this one. Plus I like both main actors.My wife and I watched it at home on DVD from our public library. It is a beautiful movie visually, with the use of mostly saturated primary colors for the costumes, and the sound design is first-rate. It evokes the glory days of 1940s and 1950s musicals.Ryan Gosling is Sebastian, a pianist and music lover, with a focus on jazz. His ambition is to own his own place in L.A. but has to make a living and plays piano gigs, getting fired regularly for too often going off on a tangent and playing experimental music.(Of note, Gosling does all his own piano playing, preparing for the role by studying piano for three months before filming.)Emma Stone is Mia, aspiring actress. To make ends meet she is a barista at a coffee bar inside the movie studio backlot.The movie sets its style early with an elaborate musical number of occupants of cars all stuck in L.A. freeway traffic. Then, Sebastian honks at Mia when she fails to move quickly enough, they shoot each other the bird, which in movie plot language means they are destined to get together.Most of the movie deals with their relationship and their individual attempts to develop their chosen careers. The two leads are easy to watch and even though the movie runs right at 2 hours it never got boring for us. SPOILERS: As the story develops each of them are successful, she gets a big acting break and a few years later she is a big star, married to someone else, and with a young child. She and her husband go for a night out to a club to hear music and it turns out to be \"Seb's\", he is running his own club. There is a fantasy dream sequence where Mia and Sebastian marry and have a family, but the end is back to reality, they did not end up together.", "helpfulness": 0.0}
{"review": "I wonder if I had just stumbled upon this movie, being Damien Chazelle's third as director, not knowing anything or knowing little about it, if I would've liked/loved/fallen head over heels for it more than I did. Because of the state of the independent film scene (and this is one of those mid-way movies like Pulp Fiction, where it has its toes in indie and mainstream Hollywood, the latter if nothing else via its stars and setting), movies like La La Land come backed with the kind of hype that usually would be reserved for, say, a Star Wars movie. It also has to do too with the director's previous, Whiplash, being a ride that gives Emotional Roller-coaster its clich\u00e9d status, since it was the announcement of a director (from my generation/exact age group) swinging for the fences. And La La Land, with its major reviews and festival runs, seemed like another one. And it is, ultimately, a great movie. Could it have been better? Hmm.Sometimes, furthermore, coming right off from seeing as movie and dumping thoughts and feelings out like a raccoon spilling a garbage can at night and scattering the contents is not always \"correct\" as one might say. It may take another viewing, or a few days, to get more of what I felt about it. But I can say that this is a movie about musicals and musical about movies, and usually these cross and twist like it's a dance out in outer space. Chazelle is also bringing a story that is so familiar - artists in music and performance, close enough as the same thing, who meet, have a little push-and-pull at first (they first meet by the usual serendipity of LA traffic jam) - that it could be criticized as a rehash. Hell, we just had a movie come out a month ago/around this same time, Nocturnal Animals, that, if you look closely, isn't too far off (though the endings are VERY different, which I'll get to what is so gobsmackingly JOYFUL about this movie).Gosling and Stone first were paired five years ago in Crazy Stupid Love, and I'm sure Chazelle knew this and bet on it being stronger this time around. Though as a nitpick (and it should be mentioned) Gosling can't sing anything exceptional, Stone can and they know how to dance and bond and kiss and bring the romance out in full force. La La Land would be a beautiful exercise in technicalities, of pulling off all of the care-free MOVIE ideas that Chazelle has (seriously, he's about as geeky in his homage as Tarantino - notice the Ingrid Bergman wall- sized poster in Mia's place and other parts, or the whole use of the WB lot), but what makes it a triumph is that the actors work well together and separately. More than well, they find the truth in the clich\u00e9s that come with artists-trying-to-make-it and sell it as well as Chazelle's script can get them to.Which, perhaps, is the one thing that keeps me from saying 'OMG THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE I've EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE' (which, again, hype) - it takes you so immediately into musical terrain with its opening number in LA traffic that it's jarring to then go back into the 'real' world, more or less. Songs of course happen, but it's a balancing act, and all the while Chazelle's story points for these two is so familiar as far as the 'What Happens When You Follow Your Dreams in Artistic/Corporate America' thing that it goes into what could almost be dangerous terrain - not embracing and finding a truth in clich\u00e9, but just being conventional (i.e. how Gosling becomes a piano player in a group John Legend's got, and this takes him away from his actual 'dream' of a jazz club, and then Stone's Mia's dream of being an actress, etc etc so forth and so on).... And then the final 15 minutes or so happens, where we flash ahead five years to what's happened with these two people who, at one point, went to the same planetarium as in Rebel Without a Cause and dance and go into the stratosphere of the galaxy (I'm reminded of the French New Wave, a lot, by the way, in how much Chazelle embraces post-modern self-consciousness; if Breathless was his Whiplash, is this his, uh, A Woman is a Woman?) And the two of them have changed, more or less, and Gosling plays a song that transports into the 'what if' and it's... I don't have words for it. It's what the movies are about. It's a magical, wonderful 15 minutes that reminded me why I can stand being around people whispering (like I don't hear you, old bastards) and munching popcorn and can be transported into a completely made-up, empathetic landscape.My first instinct is to go for the typical critical bulls*** of saying 'this is \"better\" than this' (that is Whiplash vs La La Land), but it doesn't matter. That last fifteen minutes, and many other scenes and Stone's performance and the dancing and the whole color palette and the cinematography (oh man, I don't care if you're verging from homage into rip-off of PT Anderson, it's so delicious for my eyes to look at), confirms that Chazelle is the real deal, a filmmaker with something to say about the human experience, about what it means to chase that unfortunate dragon known as the \"dream\" of artists and musicians and actors and so on, and at the same time can bring it forward with... soul. It takes a little time, but my instinct is to call this a soulful Hollywood movie first, beautiful homage second.", "helpfulness": 0.47058823529411764}
{"review": "Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who saw it before and said it was okay. The movie seems to want to be both realistic and fantasy-laden as evidenced by the location shots for the former and the more imaginative set designs for the latter. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are the leads and they both seem believable enough playing a real-life couple trying to live their dreams and also to please each other but it seems they can't do both. The original songs are pretty entertaining and their voices are, well, serviceable for their characters. Part of me did wonder if the praise was worth it but by the end, it brought a smile to me face even if the ending was not a \"happily ever after\" one. So that's a recommendation for La La Land.

The film explores a Korean family striving to make a go of things in 1980s Arkansas, and is well acted throughout by the entire cast - Will Patton is a particular scene-stealer - with a lot of weighty dialogue and small conflict between the characters.

{"review": "\"Minari\" is an American movie that was released in 2020 already, but because of the pandemic, it took until fairly recently for the film to get here to the middle of Europe, so I could finally enjoy it on a big screen. Well, enjoy slightly under half of it I could say because this was when the showing had to be stopped because of heavy rainfall, but I managed to finish the film at home. It stays under the two-hour mark, but still a fairly long film overall. The key cast is relatively small, basically the people you see on the photo here (plus the grandmother), even if the daughter does not have that much screen time either, at least the boy is more at the center of it all story-wise. But I will get to that a little later. The writer and director here is Lee Isaac Chung. Many think of him as a newcomer, but this is not really the case. He is neither particularly young nor lacking experience. More of a massive breakthrough for him with this movie because it reached way more attention than everything else he did before, probably even than everything else take taken together. Barely anybody had heard his name before this year you could say. His movie here was really one of the biggest awards players all season winning over 100 awards and being nominated (without winning) for another over 200. Massive amount. The biggest win was maybe the Oscar for supporting actress Yuh-Jung Youn and also some of the other awards she took home. The actress started her career 50 years ago, so nice anniversary with the movie that also turned her into a star internationally. Asian audiences may know her very well, even if approximately one film per year is not that much. Back to director Chung, he may roots similar to the characters in here, but he was born in America, this movie takes place entirely in America and there are also always segments in the English language. Which is why it did not contend at the Oscars for Best Foreign Language Feature. Might have been a tougher category for the Danish entry otherwise.As for the cast, I already mentioned one protagonist by name, but there are others. About Yeri Han (the mother) and Noel Cho (the daughter) I cannot say too much. However, the little boy is played by Alan S. Kim and he was even nominated for a BAFTA. Debatable if he is supporting, but it's an ensemble cast performance you could say. The BAFTAs certainly loved that little movie. Kim also has lots of screen time here and in the end even gets a little, maybe slightly rushed-inclusion linked to his health that has not been elaborated on before. And of course I must mention Steven Yeun. His success story from playing a rather beta character on The Walking Dead into becoming really the one cast member that managed the by far most successful big screen character is nothing short of impressive. His Oscar nomination here, even with some precursor attention, came as a but of a surprise and same is true about Chung's nomination for directing. But back to Yeun, I am not sure if I think he gives one of the best five mal leading performances of the year, probably not, but he definitely has his moments. The scene when he talks to the boy about what happens to male chickens was really nicely handled. Also his struggles in terms of leading his family in a new country were nicely portrayed. This includes the conflicts between him and his wife, but also other scenes like when he is about to punish his son for a little prank he pulled on his grandmother. He strives to be the head of the family and a leader, but maybe it's not really in his genes. Also how he dealt with new people, new cultures, new traditions was an interesting watch. I must of course mention the fella who carries the cross out there. Yep, the American countryside is still really religious. And surely was back then. This film is set in the 1980s as we find out for example through a mention that Reagan is PotUS. But as for Yeun, I probably would have preferred him being nominated for Burning (Beoning), but it's okay. Walking Dead fans can be happy too with him coming back for an episode, so seems as if he did not forget about his first successes, even if he acted a long time before that already.The movie basically uses some solid formulas. It is never really in your face or too over-the-top, but a quiet character study for the most part and usually quietly convincing. The one big exception is the massive fire near the end, which really poses a threat to everybody. But even there the family sticks together and everybody adds their own share of support, so they somehow make it out not just alive, but even stronger. This includes the parents, but also the grandparents and the children too. A lot of the film is about socializing. They show us how the father bonds with a new slightly nerdy colleague or how the mother makes a potential new friend at her chicken sexing profession. I never really thought about that too much. A job I would hate to make. You're basically playing God with chickens' lives. But I guess somebody has to do it. Then there is the boy making friends with one of the local boys. The latter still looks at him in a confused way earlier that you cannot be sure if he sees him as a potential friend or really dislikes him, but in general the family is accepted in a friendly way by everybody. Like there's two big American ladies there too and on one occasion they talk about how cute they find the tiny slim Asian woman. Of course, you could see some racism in that as well, but this is not the film's objective. Probably because it is about Asian immigrants and not African Americans. With the latter, it feels as if they always have to get in something like that and make powerful statements on tolerance or show evil fascists, otherwise a film cannot be complete. Well, I am glad they did not with this film here. There's enough other quality stuff elaborated on. Take for example the argument between the parents near the end when it comes to their shared (or not shared) future and what impact the situation in the new country has on their love relationship too. But yeah with the local boy we also realize he is harmless when the Asian boy suggests he wants to sleep over with his new friend. Or when the man's colleague is around to have dinner with the Asian family and everybody is super nice and friendly. This is not a film about racism or anything. Thank God.Then we have Yuh-Jung Youn. Talked about her early on already and while I am not sure if she was really Oscar-deserving, I think she really made her mark with this film. Early on, she gets in some nicer and lighter moments, but towards the end, it is also a serious role. Like we see her immediately after her stroke how she is lying there on the ground and it is heartbreaking to see her unable to speak. Or how she is disabled eventually and cannot move her arm, but still tries all she can to help her family. Help her daughter for example with doing the housework. And also sad how what she does eventually results in the fire. But there is no blame or talk about how they want to send her into a retirement home or something. On the contrary: The pretty much last line is about how the old woman chose a good spot to plant the minari. So the film is named after an Asian plant. I guess this final scene is also a key reason why the movie is named like that and you could certainly make a connection and see the place where the minari is rooted now is closely linked to where the family is rooted now and that they belong there and that also the mother decided to stay with her man. It's okay. I could have thought of other, potentially better titles, but this one fits too. Kinda fitting that the German long title even includes the German terms for \"roots\". So yeah, back to the grandmother character: It was a bit unsure if she would live in the end, but she does and they did not make the film really depressing. Still her health is deteriorating, but the son's health is getting better with his heart irregularity, so definitely a feel-good moment when the doctor informs them about it. One this movie needed maybe as well. But the boy and the grandmother also bring some food-good essence earlier. He clearly does not like her, even says so explicitly on one occasion and the pee prank is pretty telling too, but she has a good heart and forgives him quickly and does not want him to be beaten. He is also a little cheeky one with how he gets a rod that could never hurt him in any way or also how his father is so over the moon about hos smart he is or how he makes a little pee joke after the scene when he bonds with his grandmy finally when she says how strong he is.Of course, the clashing of Asian and American culture was also funny here and there. Be it talking about obese people (luckily, they did not try to deliver a fat-shaming message here, but it was all harmless) or the aforementioned religion inclusion or the old lady watching American wrestling and thinking it was all real (of course, in her country it is very real. I could say sumo, but that is more of a Japanese tingey than Korean). It's a smart and interesting movie and character study or I could say characters study because everybody gets sufficient screen time and elaboration and the attention to detail is also good. Soundtrack, i.e. Score, is also nice and I am not surprised it got nominated for an Oscar. Another multiculti inclusion if I look at the composer's name. So yeah, basically really nothing wrong with this film at all. Still I must say I also cannot really include it into my biggest favorites from 2020 and something was missing from that. There was not really a moment where I felt that the film had a chance to get a 4 out of 5 from me unfortunately, so I definitely think it is a bit overrated and the awards were also exaggerated. But luckily, there were also no moments when I thought I could give out a negative recommendation. It succeeds from beginning to end.", "helpfulness": 0.5}

{"review": "This is a poignant tale of a Korean family pursuing the American dream by working a large tract of farmland in the state of Arkansas by way of California. The life of the parents on the West Coast was hampered by work as chicken sexers, something I never heard of before but makes sense if you think about it. The females are separated to lay eggs, while the males are sorted for meat, though in the story it sounds like the males are discarded as being useless. More on this later.The most unusual and entertaining character here is the old grandma (Yuh-Jung Youn) who joins her daughter's family once they've settled into their trailer. It takes some time for the young son David (Alan S. Kim) to warm up to his grandmother, who takes pleasure in drinking water from the mountains (Mountain Dew!) and watching pro wrestlers pound each other on TV. David's offer of a cup of mountain water to grandma is the film's best humorous moment.The dichotomy in the marriage between Jacob (Steven Yeun) and Monica (Yeri Han) Yi is quite evident. Jacob is the eternal optimist in regard to establishing himself as a successful farmer of Korean vegetables, while Monica is a fatalist, not only regarding the outcome with the farm, but also relative to son David's health. I thought it somewhat fatalistic for her to suggest her son to pray to see heaven; it felt like she was preparing him for his death because of a heart condition. Fortunately grandma stepped in with sage advice to help David reorient his thinking on that. The local doctor the Yi's take David to offers further good news by stating that his heart is mending, with guidance that said \"Whatever it is you're doing, don't change a thing\". That almost felt like a rejection of Monica's negativity toward living the life of a chicken sexer and farmer's wife.Unfortunately, a tragedy that occurs due to the grandma's own infirmity, causes a near total loss of the farm's first crop. The closing scene of Jacob discovering the location of the minari patch that grandma started with a few seeds suggests the rebuilding of their family life all over again, though that outcome is left to the imagination of the viewer. One must weigh Jacob's positive, forward looking attitude against his wife's tendency toward inevitable failure. My own sense is that they stay and make a go of it all over again.Now, as to the job of chicken sexing. As often happens, when confronted with something new and odd, I'll do some research, and it turns out you can go on line and take a free test to find out if chicken sexer is one of your top career matches. A not too shabby sixty thousand dollars a year is possible, but on the flip side, it would be hard to come up with a more boring and tedious job than standing all day and separating baby chicks into different colored containers. The world record for a chicken sexer currently stands at 1,682 in an hour, though personally, I don't think that's possible myself, but I've never done it. By this time you probably think I'm making all this up, but you can check it out for yourself with an internet search. Watch the movie first though.", "helpfulness": 0.4444444444444444}
{"review": "I heard the title for this American made Korean language film a number of times when it received multiple nominations during Awards Season, so I was looking forward to watching it. Basically, set in 1983, the Korean immigrant Yi family moves from California to their new farm in rural Arkansas, where father and husband Jacob (Oscar nominated Steven Yeun) hopes to grow Korean fruits and vegetables to sell to vendors in Dallas. His first decision is to dig a well for a natural source of water. He enlists the help of eccentric local man and Korean War veteran Paul (Will Patton). While Jacob is optimistic about the life ahead, his wife Monica (Yeri Han) is disappointed and worries about their son David (BAFTA nominated Alan S. Kim). He suffers from a heart condition and is frequently told not to run. Jacob and Monica also find work separating chicks from male to female at the nearby hatchery. The couple have constant arguments about their situation, with David and his sister Anne (Noel Cho) eavesdropping. The couple arrange for Monica's mother Soonja (Oscar and BAFTA winning Yuh-Jung Youn) to travel from South Korea to help look after the children during the day. David is forced to share a room with her grandmother, who he hardly knows. He avoids her because she does not conform to being a conventional grandmother, often being rude, but she tries to adjust to life in America and bond with the children. The well that Jacob dug runs dry. Jacob is reluctant to pay for water services, but eventually is forced to do so. He runs into further difficulties, including a Dallas vendor cancelling their order at the last minute. But he perseveres despite Monica's telling him she wishes to return to California. This strains their marriage closer to the breaking point. Meanwhile, Soon-ja takes the children to plant minari seeds by the river. She tells them that minari is a most resilient and useful plant and predicts plentiful growth. Minari is a weed-like vegetable thrive in tough circumstances and flourishes in its second season after dying and being reborn. David finally begins to warm to his grandmother after she teaches him card games, bandages his wounds, and helps him to sleep. Soon-ja also encourages him to do more physical activity, something his parents discourage, saying that he is stronger than they think. Soon-ja suddenly suffers a stroke, she survives with medical treatment, but is left with impaired movement and speech. Jacob, Monica, Anne, and David travel to Oklahoma City for David's heart appointment and to meet a vendor to sell Jacob's produce. They learn that David's heart condition has dramatically improved, and Jacob makes a deal to sell vegetables to a Korean grocer. But Jacob indirectly admits to Monica that the success of his crops is more important to him than the stability of their family. Following an emotional argument, the two silently agree to separate. In their absence, Soon-ja accidentally sets the barn containing the produce on fire. Upon arriving home, Jacob rushes in to save the crops, and Monica soon follows. Eventually, the fire gets out of control, but the couple decide to save each other, leaving the barn to burn. A distraught and confused Soon-ja begins to wander off into the distance. Anne and David call for her to come back, but she does not respond. David sprints after her, she takes his hand, and the grandchildren lead her back home. The family fall asleep on the floor, exhausted from the night before. Above them, Soon-ja is awake, in a chair, watching them sleep with a subdued expression on her face. Sometime later, Jacob and Monica are with the water diviner who finds a spot for a well. They intend to stay on the farm and place a marker stone to signify this. Jacob and David then head to the river to harvest the minari, which had grown successfully, with Jacob noting how good a spot their grandmother picked to plant them.

{"review": "If this had been about Italian immigrants it might have been called \"Parsley\". If about Central American immigrants, maybe \"Cilantro.\" The title is a reference to Minari seeds grandma brought from South Korean and plants near a stream.Based on a certain amount of hype, my wife and I were expecting a bit more from this movie. It is based on the recollections of a man and his boyhood experiences in the 1980s, as a first generation American and his immigrant family. They had settled first in California but moved to Arkansas, into a trailer home, to establish their farm. They survive initially by sexting chicken hatchlings, only the females make good-tasting chickens. There are some family problems and rough spots with the farm. When the movie ends there is no definite conclusion, we don't know if grandma's health improves or even if the farm is successful.So while we enjoyed it enough it isn't the kind we might re-watch.

The story centres around a Korean family who emigrate to Arkansas in Ronald Reagan's United States and attempt to make a go of things. In itself, the story is nothing especially innovative - what does resonate, though, is the way in which the entire family are portrayed by director Lee Isaac Chung as a unit. Although it is \"Jacob\" (Steven Yeun) who is the breadwinner, the story thoughtfully develops the characters of the young son - and star of the film for me - \"David\" (Alan Kim) and of his own mother \"Soonja\" (Oscar winning Yuh-Jung Youn), and we are soon immersed in their efforts to conform to their new environment without surrendering their own cultural and familial identities. It draws heavily on language - there is little English spoken and that works well. It gives an English speaking audience a sense of the bewilderment experienced by those in a society who do not all speak the native language, and so we, here, share a sense of how they (largely only speaking Korean) had to fit in on a societal as well as physical level. It's especially potent as the underlying premiss of hard work, decency and to a certain extent, mundanity, must ring true for so many of America's original founding-fathers who arrived in a new land full of hope, opportunity and apprehension. On the downside, it is a little too long - at times it succeeds too well in illustrating their daily lives as we might experience our own, and that isn't always that interesting, but the ensemble - both Korean and local - work well together, and both the young Kim and the sparing appearances of his grandmother provide us with delightful performances that deliver both humour and affection.

And it's not like \"Minari\" is lacking in merits. It's just that it feels formulaic in a way \"The Farewell\" didn't, and it doesn't feel as urgent as that other movie.The movie is largely autobiographical, so the director and screenwriter, Lee Isaac Chung, was mostly sticking to what he knows first hand. Fine with me. But that means a film set decades ago that lacks substantial dramatic conflict. It positions itself early on as a film about the immigrant experience and what it feels like to be a stranger in a strange land. But the Korean family at the film's center is pretty much accepted by the rural Arkansas community they choose as their adopted home and the main conflict transitions into a domestic drama revolving around a wife who gets frustrated at her husband's dogged pursuit of a dream that leaves the family scrounging. True to life events, maybe, but less interesting. Throw in the young child who's pampered and needs to learn that he's tougher than he thinks he is and the irascible grandma who teaches him that lesson, and you've got something it feels like we've seen many times before.The grandmother is played by Yuh Jung Youn, who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance.

{"review": "Greetings again from the darkness. \"The American Dream\" could actually be labeled 'The Human Dream'. The idea of being part of a loving and supportive family, while achieving a bit of societal success and living comfortably and safely in a home one can call their own, is a dream that bears no boundaries, gender, or skin color. This autobiographical film from writer-director Lee Isaac Chung is centered on his childhood recollections of his family move to rural Arkansas to start a farm.It's the 1980s and this Korean immigrant family has packed up to leave their dead-end California life to begin anew on a 50 acre parcel in Arkansas. Father Jacob (Steven Yeun, \"The Walking Dead\") has a dream of cultivating Korean vegetables to fill the demand from an increasing Korean populace. Mother Monica (Yeri Han) sees less dream and more nightmare as they drive far from a city and pull up to a tattered mobile home (\"it has wheels\"). Their young son David (Alan S Kim) has health concerns from a closely monitored heart murmur, and is constantly being ordered to \"don't run, David!\" David's older sister Anne (Noel Cho) is mature and smart for her age, and acts as his life guide.Monica and Jacob take jobs at a local hatchery to support the family while the farm is developed. The hatchery job is exactly what they escaped from in California, so Monica sees their situation as worse, not better ... foreseeing failure on the farm. A heartfelt argument leads to compromise and Monica's mother Soonja (Yuh-jung Youn) comes to live with them. As David notes, she's not a \"normal grandmother\". Rather than bake cookies, she freely spews profanity and quite enjoys the \"water from mountains\" (Mountain Dew) amidst her practical jokes at the expense of others. In other words, she's a hoot!Jacob accepts the offer of help from Paul (longtime favorite character actor Will Patton), a local evangelical Christian who praises Jesus frequently, and has an unusual Sunday ritual. The two men manage to cultivate the crops, yet run in to many obstacles along the way. But Chung's film is clever in that the real core is family dynamics. Grandma's planting of fast-growing minari herb in the creek bed acts as a metaphor for the plight of this family. Each member finds their way, and it's clearly stronger as a unit than broken.This is such a beautiful film with a gentle story grounded in realism. These people talk and act like a family, and the pressures they face are real. Racism in the south is never dwelled upon, but the struggles of a changing citizenry is faced by all. Emile Mosseri's score is unusual, but fits perfectly, while Lachlan Milne's cinematography at times reminds of Terrence Malick, possibly due to the setting.

Kim,Yeri Han,Steven Yeun,Youn Yuh-jung and Will Patton) trying to remain together,whilst attempting to grow The American Dream.Igniting an emotional punch of a ending, Chung puts out the flames of disagreement between David, his aunt Soon-ja and husband/wife David & Monica with a poetic final scene, where from out of the flames they have battled through, the family discover green shoots.", "helpfulness": 0.3076923076923077}

{"review": "'Minari', the autobiographical film written and directed in 2020 by the American filmmaker Lee Isaac Chung, a son of Korean immigrants, has some beautiful moments and quite a lot of cinematic qualities. It is an immigrants story, one of the millions of episodes that have built throughout history the complex mosaic of the American nation and history. It is also a family drama evoking episodes related to the economic adaptation and the overcoming of the psychological and cultural barriers that so many immigrant families have faced and are facing. It's a good film that deserves to be watched, but which also has weaker points related to the lack of epic breath and character development, with too many aspects within the limit of the predictable. The amount - exaggerated in my opinion - of awards and nominations with which this film was overwhelmed seems to me to be more related to the specific moment the American film industry goes through and to the ensemble of the productions offered to the public this year which is so different of the previous ones.The story in 'Minari' takes place in the '80s. Jacob (Steven Yeun) and Monica (Yeri Han) move to Arkansas from California, where they spent their early - not very successful - years as immigrants. They bought a piece of land that may be fertile, with only a caravan on it, and began to work hard to achieve their dream of growing Korean vegetables in the heart of the United States. Meanwhile, in order to meet ends they take day jobs in a chicken farm. They have two children, a teenage daughter and a younger boy who has heart problems, and after a while they are joined by Monica's mother. Economic pressures and social isolation are beginning to make their effects felt on family life and the relationship between the two. Neighbours are not necessarily hostile to them, maybe just indifferent, maybe just clumsy in approaching them and creating social ties despite language and culture barriers. I will not go into more details about the story so as not to rob the future viewers' pleasure. Placing the story of the film almost four decades ago, screenwriter and director Lee Isaac Chung avoids comments and direct references to the current situation of immigrants, specifically those coming from Asia, and the way they are received and integrated into America today. I am sure that the spectators will make the connections themselves, and those who have gone through the experiences of emigration will recognise many of the situations and attitudes.What I liked? 'Minari' is beautifully filmed and illustrated musically and excellently acted. Aside from the two lead actors who finely portray the dynamics of the relationship between the two spouses, I can't help but mention Will Patton, one of those American actors whom I recognise from dozens of supporting roles and who I hope will he someday get s a leading role up to his obvious talent. Here Patton plays the role of Jacob's partner, a man with a big heart, who carries his cross, literally, at certain moments. The film is mostly spoken in Korean, and this choice, far from being a gimmick or an attempt to fill a quota imposed by Hollywood, gives the film authenticity. My family is also one of immigrants in a foreign language country, and this is exactly what our linguistic mixture between the languages of the old and the new homeland looks like. Family issues related to economic pressures and intergenerational conflicts, and relationships with neighbours, including prejudices and naiveties, as well as the role played by the church in bringing newcomers closer to the community, are sensitively portrayed. What I liked less? The film has emotion, but lacks narrative consistency. The sincerity and simplicity of the approach works well at times, but falls into melodrama at some other moments. For this reason, the scenes in which children are involved, which often save films and raise the emotional level, seem at some instances melodramatic here. The qualities of 'Minari' are exactly the reasons that take it out of the category of films that collect many Academy Awards, but given that we are in an unusual year (also) for cinema, who knows?", "helpfulness": 0.2857142857142857}

We feel the family's otherness, but at the same time, they aren't subjected to hatred or racism; in fact, it's the opposite. It's a story of struggle in so many ways though - the hard life of making a farm work in rural Arkansas of all places, of keeping a marriage together despite goals shifting over time, and dealing with serious health issues in the young and old. At the same time, director Lee Isaac Chung is wonderfully restrained in how he presents this story. The relationship the little boy (Alan Kim) has with his grandmother (Youn Yuh-jung) is funny and touching as it evolves, but it's never cloying. There is great authenticity in these characters, and in scenes like the cruel chick sorting of the poultry industry.

{"review": "\"Minari\" is an exceptionally well-made picture especially for being somewhat simplistic in its depiction of a farm family. The pleasant imagery and music works in a Terrence Malick-light sort of way, although there's not always enough here to contemplate to earn such languid lyricism--largely comprised of bromides on the American Dream, the Nation of Immigrants and some tilted balance between reason and spirituality. Even the pseudoscience of dowsing for well water is strangely celebrated. That's not something I care to bother thinking about during wistful compositions of 1980s rural Arkansas, let alone a man dragging a cross along a gravel road on Sundays. There are better parts here, though. The acting in uniformly good, including an Oscar-nominated performance from Steven Yeun (perhaps best known for leaving \"The Walking Dead\" TV series before it really got bad) and an Oscar-winning one from Youn Yuh-jung as an amusing grandma. The most interesting aspect I find in \"Minari,\" however, might be its rather symbolic treatment of masculinity. It's also what greatly separates it from the last foreign-language movie to receive awards attention and that was a semi-autobiographical nostalgia trip on the filmmaker's boyhood, \"Roma\" (2018), which was more focused on female rearing of children.Motifs for all four of the classical elements revolve around masculinity: air, earth, fire and water. Tornados, farm dirt, groundwater wells and even urine, for which one might also consider that \"mountain water.\" It's just intriguing symmetry that the picture begins and ends with the threat of burning males. Early on there's the burning of male chicks from the parents' sexing side hustle, for which the boy asks his father on his cigarette break about the factory's smoke. He's advised to make himself useful lest he face the fate of the cockerels, who neither lay eggs nor are desired for eating. And, later, we have the father running into a burning structure in a desperate act to preserve his upwardly-socially-mobile breadwinning. In the meantime, the boy's masculinity is depicted as veering constantly between being initiated and threatened. His father teaches him something about farming, and another dad insists that he help his with the farm, as well, and there's even the chewing tobacco. On the other hand, the farm might fail and the mother might leave the father for the feminized city. He's the younger sibling of an older sister, and he must share a room after the grandmother moves in to unbalance the household's equal gender ratio. He's not allowed to run because his heart might give out. He's called \"pretty\" instead of \"good looking.\" Heck, grandma even mocks his bedwetting by repeating that his penis is broken. Surprisingly emasculating stuff for a movie about a child. I'll resist the urge to fall back on my film theory education by getting overly psychanalytical about all this, but it's rather asking for it.I also won't get into detail regarding it, but it also goes to a point some have made regarding the desexualized stereotype of Asian male characters, perhaps in conjunction with the hyper-sexualization of female ones. A documentary I recently saw, \"Hollywood Chinese\" (2007), that included interviews from the likes of BD Wong on playing such demasculized or feminized characters. To cite another film I (re)visited not long ago, the cook in \"King Kong\" (1933) would be a specific example--a character that at one point even imagines himself in the role occupied by Fay Wray. Certainly, Yeun has done well do play against this type.Ultimately, this prevalent male-centric fear of emasculation is balanced partly by a couple strong female characters: the mother and the grandmother. In their own ways, they may ultimately rescue the men and their manhood, whether running into the fire beside them or literalizing taking the piss out of them. Note the final shot, too; it's of father and son, but look at the feminized space with which their masculinity has come to a compromise. Not just the American dream, the merging of American and Korean culture, religion and science, but also a balance of female and male.", "helpfulness": 0.3333333333333333}

{"review": "\"Nomadland\" is a new American movie that premiered back in 2020 already though. Took me until the second half of 2021 to finally watch this because I was surely going for the movie theater experience here. I also see this is a German co-production. Okay, that I did not expect honestly. Luckily, German media did not brand this as one of their own. I still kinda wonder where the German impact is. Anyway, the director is Chlo\u00e9 Zhao and she is still under 40 and now only the second woman to win a Best Directing Oscar. At the same time, she also won Best Picture (just like Bigelow back then) and was also nominated for the screenplay and editing. Having seen Zhao's The Rider a few years ago, I am tempted to say I liked that one even more than this one here, even if the gap is not massive. Both are decent movies. Still it feels as if Zhao focuses very much on lifestyle out there in the open with a connection to nature and also to America. Surely not a given as she was born in China herself. But her very first film over a decade ago (but less than 15 years) was in the English language already and like so many other she, in her early 20s then, launched her career through short films. Also nothing entirely new that she worked as a writer and editor on her releases. For this approximately 105-minute movie she adapted Jessica Bruder's novel. I am pretty sure the latter would not have expected her film to become a Best Picture winner at some point at the Academy Awards. Many other awards here. The lead actress is Frances McDormand and she already won her third acting Oscar and took home one in producing as well. More about her later on. Her howling moment at the Oscars was a bit difficult to understand as it is not just the isolation / lone wolf reference to nomads, but a story linked closely to the production of this film. The biggest surprise was maybe that the Oscar for cinematography went to another film because Nomadland really dominated this category all awards season long.So with McDormand she was not a safe pick to win this year in a really close Best Actress category. But in the end she pulled through in a similar scenario maybe like it was with her first Oscar win, even if now with her third (and fourth) there were probably even more potential winners. Her second was as safe as it gets though and also fairly recent, which may be the reason why this one here was so heavily-contested. But Hollywood seems to love her enough. She has as many acting Oscars as Streep now and all in lead even and more Oscars in total. Pretty impressive. Then again, she is probably not worse than Streep, so maybe not undeserving and honestly, she really is this movie here from beginning to end. She is in almost every single scene. Every time supporting players have a bigger impact, it is because her character Fern is nearby. Also pay attention to her character's name here and her real name. Not too different. With every other cast member, they went for the real first name. This includes David Strathairn who is always a welcome presence for me, even if the just called him Dave this time. All the other cast members are unknown. I know that Zhao in the past picked non-actors, locals for the part. People who originate from the area in which her films are set. So it could very well be you see some actual nomads here. They are pulling this off really nicely. I mean they do not have deep material or a really great deal of screen time, but moments like the bird nest speech were nicely handled nonetheless. The consequence is that this movie feels a lot like a documentary for the most part. The only exception are maybe the scenes during which Fern is with her family or at her friend's house in the end. All the scenes out there in the open feel as if you were actually watching nomads.And as good as McDormand may have been (and I said this is her movie), I would still say that some of my favorite moments came from the others. Strathairn of course with my personal preference, but I already mentioned the monologue of the dying woman about the bird nests. The one they compare to Santa is alright too, maybe if him opening up about his son near the end was a bit too much perhaps. I mean he never seemed this close to Fern. The scene when they say goodbye (or \"see you down the road\") to one character is pretty nice too. Or what people have to say at the camp fire. So yeah, a character dying from cancer is as serious as it gets, but at the same time we find out she has lived the life she wanted to life and is happy about it. There is a component of closure and fulfillment there. It's not depressing. There are also no really dangerous moments in here. The biggest drama is when a character accidentally breaks something from another character. No scenes where people are threatened by bears or bitten by snakes or something. In general, animals did not play the most crucial role here the way you could have expected from a film like this. You get her driving next to a buffalo on one occasions. Not a lot more. This makes sense though. It may include a great deal of wilderness and beautiful sceneries and landscapes, but in the end it is a documentary about humans and not about animals, a bit about the environment they thrive in. In general, you could see really many stunning landscapes here.Fern's isolation was also depicted nicely through her choices in life. She went away from her sister. Actually, she is so hesitant to ask her to stay for a while that she goes and asks a friend (or \"friend\") for money and there again it shows why she is simply not good with humans. This also shows when she is supposed to hold a baby during the final stages of a movie and we see she is just not like Dave and does not fit in there. She tried, but also did not fit in with her family earlier. Immediate arguing happens. Or take the scene in which she is asked if she can adopt a dog and says not. She is much more into her car obviously as we find out on several occasions. This is not about cute animal companions. More about finding others out there in the open. But most of all finding yourself. Look how she says goodbye to that dog. I mean she does not despise other creatures. She's just not good with them. Another thing I liked about the movie was the entire sound component. The music, but also how they managed to show the difference between noise (usually at her workplaces like Amazon and also kitchen work) and quietness or relaxation when she is out there living her nomad life. A really soothing experience at times, even if Fern always has to worry about making ends meet. Maybe not a movie you wanna watch when you are a bit tired. Not that it is bad or anything. Absolutely not. But there's good and not so good situations for all movies. In general, the main intention by Zhao here was to come as close to reality as possible and I think she succeeded nicely with that. Also telling that the ending is as simple and unspectacular as it gets. Make it a character study in terms of Fern, but also elaborate from beginning to end on what life mor modern-day nomads looks like. I think the film is set less than a decade ago in the past. Probably same time it was set in the book. Overall, there are tempting aspects of course when it comes to nomads and their lives (most of all, the focus on nature and the lack of big civilizations), but then there's scenes in which we find out she asks for discounts if she does without electricity or, even if included in a playful manner, the elaboration on toilet buckets on one occasion.Okay, that is pretty much it then. It's a decent film all in all, but the gigantic amount of awards recognition seems a bit exaggerated to me, especially Zhao's direction basically dominating awards season from beginning to end. Then again, most of the other contenders did not really blow me away this year. At least those I have seen so far. There is still a lot to go for. I have high hopes for Minari especially. But that is another story. I think this film here deserves a watch, even if I expected and hoped I could like this a lot more with my connection to nature and my liking in the lead actress. But yeah, it's going down a bit as well now, especially with her Oscar acceptance speech a few years ago. This one was better. Or I should say \"these\" in terms of the 2021 Oscars because she won several. I'm still curious what's up for McDormand next in terms of movies. Nomadland gets a positive recommendation and thumbs-up from me without really only very minor hesitation. It's also still far away from a good film I must say unfortunately and I doubt I will add one or even two stars on rewatch here to my imdb rating at some point in the future. It's still a solid enough mix of lightness and seriousness all in all and I especially liked that they did not try too hard to get in really many funny moments arising from conversation. The one thing this film surely does is feel natural. In terms of the setting, but also in terms of the characters and that is maybe the biggest achievement. So yeah, go check it out, preferrably on a big screen. I guess at home on a laptop or something and also if you are not that much into McDormand, it will maybe even be a tougher call if it deserves a thumbs-up. But then again, she rightfully said at the Oscars to watch this and others on the biggest screen possible and I agree with that, even if it's maybe not a film that will turn you into a McDormand fan like some of her others could. And that includes even her very, very old stuff like Blood Simple, even if that one barely got any awards recognition. But hey a movie about humans practicing a social distancing lifestyle and a great deal of isolation? Of course this had to win liberal Hollywood's Best Picture Oscar during the pandemic. Never in doubt. Now that's really it.", "helpfulness": 0.25}

{"review": "If not for the presence of Frances McDormand and David Straithairn, one would almost consider this film to be a documentary rather than a fictional story. It explores the plight of vagabond folks living on the road between somewhat longer stops to work for a spell before moving on again. McDormand's appearance is almost shocking compared to prior films, here she looks haggard and ravaged due to circumstances forcing her to leave her once home town of Empire, Nevada, a location that no longer has a zip code due to the local Gypsum Company plant closing down, and taking virtually all of it's residents with it. McDormand's character Fern searches out employment at various locations, making enough to get by until the major expense of a broken down van requires reaching out to a sister for financial help. A certain sadness permeates the film, as one realizes that the freedom offered by living on the road carries with it a trade off, as relationships formed become at best temporary, and often times one is reduced to mending a broken plate rather than incurring an additional expense. Yet the handful of vagabonds we meet from place to place are always reluctant to offer their good-byes, rather having a more positive attitude that suggests \"I'll see you down the road.\" This film will certainly not appeal to a large segment, as the pace is rather drawn out and is heavy on dialog, though the impact of the message will resonate for those of a compassionate nature. The film just earned a Best Drama Picture at the recent Golden Globes, and even though I generally agree with it's commendable IMDb rating, I'm not sure if that would have been the best selection against competition like \"Mank\" and \"The Trial of the Chicago Seven\", but for those of a wandering spirit, it might certainly earn that distinction.", "helpfulness": 0.6296296296296297}

{"review": "No worldwide pandemic was going to stop Awards Season, and thankfully many films had been made before the lockdowns happened, including this film that was getting many award nominations, based on a non-fiction book, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning director Chlo\u00e9 Zhao (the first woman of colour to win, and only the second female). Basically, set in 2011, the United States Gypsum Corporation plant in Empire, Nevada is shut down, and the town's ZIP code was discontinued. Fern (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Frances McDormand, also producing) worked there for years along with her husband, who has recently died. Having lost her job, Fern decides to sell most of her belongings and buy a van to live in and travel the country searching for work. She takes a seasonal job at an Amazon delivery packaging and shipment centre through the winter. Fern's friend and co-worker Linda (Linda May) invites her to visit a desert rendezvous in Arizona organised by Bob Wells (himself), which provides a support system and community for fellow nomads. Fern initially declines but changes her mind as the weather becomes cold, and she struggles to find work in the area. At the rendezvous, Fern learns basic survival and self-sufficiency skills for the road and meets many other nomads. When a tyre blows on Fern's van, she asks fellow nomad Swankie (Charlene Swankie) for a ride to town to buy a spare. Swankie berates Fern for not being prepared and they become good friends as she helps her to learn more road survival skills. Swankie tells Fern that she was diagnosed with cancer has a short life expectancy. She plans to make good memories on the road rather than spend whatever time she has left in hospital. They eventually part ways. Fern later finds work as a camp host at the Cedar Pass Campground in Badlands National Park. There she meets Dave (David Strathairn), another nomad working there temporarily; she met and danced with back at the desert community. Dave falls ill, and Fern visits him at the hospital where he has emergency surgery. The two of them later take restaurant jobs at Wall Drug in South Dakota. One night Dave's son visits the restaurant to inform him that his wife is pregnant and asking Dave to meet his grandchild. Dave is hesitant, but Fern encourages him to go. Dave suggests that she come with him, but she declines. Fern takes a new job at a sugar beet processing plant, but her van breaks down, and she cannot afford the repairs. Unable to borrow money, she visits her sister's family at their home in California. Her sister lends her the money, but questions why Fern was never around in their lives and why she stayed in Empire after her husband died. Fern's sister tells her she is brave to be so independent. Fern later visits Dave and his son's family; she learns that Dave has decided to stay with them long-term. Dave admits feelings for Fern and invites her to stay with him permanently in a guest house, but she decides to leave after only a few days and heads to the ocean. Fern returns to her Amazon job and later revisits the Arizona rendezvous. There she learns that Swankie has died, and she and the other nomads pay tribute to her life. Fern talks to Bob about her loving relationship with her late husband, and Bob shares the story of his son's recent suicide. Bob has the view that goodbyes are not final in the nomad community as its members always promise to see each other again \"down the road.\" Sometime later, Fern returns to the nearly abandoned town of Empire to get rid of belongings she has been keeping in a storage unit. She visits the factory and the home she shared with her husband before returning to the road again. Also starring Gay DeForest as Gay, Patricia Grier as Patty, Angela Reyes as Angela, Carl R. Hughes as Carl, Douglas G. Soul as Doug, and Ryan Aquino as Ryan.

{"review": "After her husband dies and she loses her job at a Nevada sheetrock plant that permanently shuts down (emptying out the entire town of Empire), a fiercely independent and stubbornly self-sufficient woman in her early 60s takes to the road in her RV. Unwilling to file early for Social Security benefits--and equally unwilling to put down roots with family or friends, both of whom offer shelter--she takes on a series of seemingly temporary jobs, living in her vehicle and stopping at various parks and parking lots to rest up before taking to the road again. Jessica Bruder's nonfiction book \"Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century\" from 2017 has become a very personal film for star and co-producer Frances McDormand, writer-director-editor Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, and a large cast of mostly non-actors playing themselves. Our heroine, Fern, is eccentrically driven and a hard worker, though the film's narrative--splintered and spotty and darting about--only allows us quick snippets of her days and nights. For instance, we don't know where the money goes that she earns working various jobs; we don't understand why having a roof over head makes her feel boxed in (putting her on the defensive, as if the road was a jealous lover); and we don't know why she prefers living a Worst Case Scenario lifestyle instead of formulating a plan to improve her conditions. Fern experiences the desert, the mountain forests and the ocean, and she loves the freedom nature allows her...but what are we to feel about her when she refuses help? I didn't find Fern particularly likable; McDormand plays her with a tight smile and quick, friendly herky-jerky movements (she's not anti-social), but we don't learn what makes her tick. She's a \"nomad\", a drifter, and always has been (according to her sister), so there's not a dramatic character arc here. Fern doesn't want a man in her life, she doesn't want a home. She's loyal, and a good listener, but she seems to be not just a hard luck case but a bad luck case. By the third act--when fellow-traveler David Strathairn hands Fern a baby to hold--I was more concerned with the baby's safety than enjoying Fern's motherly affection for it. **1/2 from ****", "helpfulness": 0.5}

{"review": "Frances McDormand is \"Fern\", a lady in her sixties who has found herself rootless after her town has effectively been shut down by recession. She packs what few possessions she has into her van, and sets off travelling through the American west where she encounters plenty of like minded individuals who, either by necessity or design, are living similarly transient lives. The majority of the characters she meets are real life \"nomads\", and it is they who give the film it's potency - they are not actors, but they deliver with some aplomb a series of cameos depicting their lives, their problems, their motivations and their aspirations. These may be itinerant people in terms of their lifestyles, but they are convivial, bright, engaging, intelligent people with their own sense of decency and community that director Chlo\u00e9 Zhao does much to demystify. Essentially, these people are little different from their more static compatriots, living an existence that - especially in the winter - is both harsh and challenging. I struggled a bit with the dramatic parts of the film, though. The scenes with David Strathairn (\"Dave\") seem to clutter up what is otherwise an authentically delivered effort to expose us to a way of living that the vast majority of us will never have experienced, and for the most part will take a fairly pejorative approach to. The excellent McDormand is in her element, and the intensity of the film is at it's best when she is amongst her new companions. It's not always an easy film watch - there are high points, certainly, but there are plenty of poignant moments where loneliness and isolation play their part; particularly in the winter when their accommodation offers little by way of shelter from the biting cold. The travelling folks take to the screen like ducks to water, a testament to the star and the director's ability to draw out some effective storytelling from a cast who, most originally, have an unique story to tell.

{"review": "I cried through about 75% of \"Nomadland,\" and I'm not even sure I could explain why.Well, maybe I can. This past year, the year of COVID as I write this review, has been one of tremendous loss in many ways for almost everyone. Even if you didn't lose anyone close to COVID (I didn't), you said goodbye to life as we knew it and realized how many things we thought were mundane were the source of little joys once we could no longer have them. We said goodbye to a vision of America as a nation of people who maybe have their differences but are able to unite in a common cause when it matters most. I personally said goodbye to my Dad (from leukemia, not COVID). And the entire human race is constantly reminded that we're saying goodbye to our planet.\"Nomadland\" taps into all of this sadness and just ruminates on it. It doesn't draw conclusions, it doesn't judge, it doesn't manipulate, it doesn't politicize. It's deeply melancholy but it's not depressing. It's about how hard it is to just be a human being living on this planet and the various ways we all go go about trying to find our way to cope with it. It's about community and friendship and how much those things can help stave off loneliness, but it's also about how, even with those things, life is still really lonely.Many people are reading \"Nomadland\" as a celebration of freedom from a certain kind of American capitalist doctrine that keeps us all enslaved in the pursuit of stuff. But I didn't read it that way. Our guide through the story is Fern, played by Frances McDormand in a performance so good she doesn't seem to be acting. Fern has lost pretty much everything as the movie begins. Her husband has died from a lingering illness. The factory that kept her small town employed has shut down and the town has literally disappeared. The nomadic life we see her living seems less like something she's chosen out of a spirit of rebellion and more like something she's been forced into. Likewise, many of the people she befriends along the way, played in most cases by non-actors actually living as nomads, seem more like damaged peopled gingerly finding their way to some healing rather than free souls taking charge of their own destinies. They all give the impression of being like Fern -- people who have rejected what America has to offer because it rejected them first.That's not to say that once thrust into this new lifestyle there aren't benefits and advantages to be had. We get a glimpse of some of the alternatives in a scene where Fern visits her sister and another where she spends some time with the family of a man she forms a bond with (David Strathairn, in an understated and excellent performance). Through small gestures and the look in her eyes, McDormand is able to convey that Fern perhaps wishes she could be happy with what these people have. They have family, friends, comfort. But she just can't settle. She's a restless spirit, was one before her circumstances changed, and is even more so in the aftermath. She doesn't seem to completely fit in anywhere, her loneliness is palpable, and if loneliness isn't a primary facet of the human condition, I don't know what is.I was blown away by director Chloe Zhao's last movie, \"The Rider,\" and my love of that movie and the praise \"Nomadland\" has been receiving from critics and awards groups made me worry that my expectations would be too high for it to meet. But they weren't. I'm not at all surprised that this movie is resonating so much with people. It's one of those movies that captures the feeling of a moment. We're a damaged, grieving nation, and Fern the character, though her specific personality and circumstances may differ in the details, captures what it feels like to be American right now.Grade: A+", "helpfulness": 0.5161290322580645}
{"review": "Greetings again from the darkness. Traditional beauty is nowhere to be found in filmmaker Chloe Zhao's extraordinary film adapted (by Ms. Zhao) from Jessica Bruder's 2017 award-winning book, \"Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century\". There are no breathtaking shots of majestic sites like the Grand Canyon, and the people we meet rarely bathe, and are not concerned with fashion. Despite this, the film can best be described as one of the most beautiful and most unique cinema experiences in years. Ms. Zhao provides a look at America's roads and landscape through the eyes of folks that society tends to overlook.A significant reason this film works is the incredible performance by two-time Oscar winner Frances McDormand (FARGO, 1996, and THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI, 2017). She plays Fern, a strong woman who refuses to let grief suffocate her. Her hometown of Empire, Nevada was erased from existence in 2011 when US Gypsum shut down the local plant, resulting in the town's zip code being discontinued a few months later. As if her town disappearing wasn't enough, Fern's husband passed away, leaving her with little evidence of a life to which she had grown accustomed. We watch as Fern packs up her van and hits the road.Her first stop is working at an Amazon distribution center during the holiday rush season. She lives out of her van as part of the company-sponsored CamperForce program. When the season is over, Fern hits the road again. We slowly get a feel for this subculture of van-dwelling nomads, young and old, who travel the country's backroads and keep to themselves, except when they gather to form a temporary community of similar-minded individuals. Fern makes it clear she is \"house-less\", not \"homeless\", and has nicknamed her customized vehicle, 'Vanguard'.Fern thrives on her solitude, but is also friendly enough to connect with others wherever she stops driving or works. She joins the annual gathering of Bob Wells' community/tribe, and her other odd jobs include acting as a \"host\" at one of the stops, shoveling sugar beets at a farm, and cooking/cleaning/serving at the famous Wall Drug Store in South Dakota. Along the way she befriends Dave (David Strathairn), a fellow nomad whose dreams don't necessarily coincide with Ferns. Respected actor Strathairn is the only other familiar face in the film, other than McDormand. Non-professional actors fill the scenes, most of whom are real life nomads kind enough to share their ways in front of a camera.Director Zhao has reunited with Joshua James Richards, her cinematographer on the excellent 2017 film, THE RIDER. Their work here is a masterclass in taking us into a world most of us know little about, and doing so in a way that combines both the intimacy of people with the scale of nature. Even the sequence where Fern revisits her past life is quietly emotional and done with grace, while also packing a punch. The music from Ludovico Einaudi is exceptional in its complementary nature and ability to leave the quiet moments unspoiled, while also driving our empathy and emotions. This is an extraordinary film with a superb performance, and one that is entertaining, while also proving thought-provoking at a time when so many of us are questioning the sustainability of our current societal structure, and wondering just who will toss a rock on the fire in remembrance.\nIn theatres and PVOD on Hulu beginning February 19, 2020", "helpfulness": 0.5833333333333334}
{"review": "Nomadland won three Oscars and it's well deserved even though I wouldn't say it was the best motion picture of that year, or the best directed one but that's just my opinion. Frances McDormand though deserves her Oscar. She's an actress that always delivers and in Nomadland she looks so natural playing her character that it almost looks like a documentary. Some of the rest of the cast are actual nomads, living from day to day, from one place to another, far away from the rat race, and that's what makes this movie stand out. Watching people living completely different than what the norm is supposed to be is just entertaining. I applaud people that do their own thing, sometimes by choice but too often because society gave them no other option. It's a hard life, but when you think about it I'm almost sure those nomads are happier than anyone else. The idea of camping in the most beautiful sceneries, it's a luxury some pay a lot of money for every vacation. Living like this is a choice and it seems like the best choice if you're fed up with the mass consumption society where you need to produce all the time, just to fit in. Nomadland is a good movie, maybe not the happiest movie, but certainly food for thought.", "helpfulness": 0.42857142857142855}
{"review": "\"See you down the Road.\" Bob WellsNomadland may take the Oscar for best picture, and Frances McDormand as Fern may take it for actor. If not, then you will still see an unusual movie better than most screened in 2020.Bob Wells (see above) has popular YouTube segments that teach daily survival for those who have taken to the highways to survive a disinterested economy. In the fiction-verit\u00e9 mode, Nomadland chronicles the travels of widowed, disenfranchised Fern living in an RV and a life still ready to be lived in her '60's.Here's a road trip with no guns or sweat (at least not in the fall, winter, or spring) and a modified happy-go-lucky attitude except when you have to pay for a new tire or buy a newer RV. Fern grieves for her deceased husband by smelling his overalls and surviving best as she can now that she has no mining company to provide her with a tract home or daily food.In the drama's favor is the use of mostly camera-ready amateurs and pop-cult pros like Bob to take the narrative into entertaining stories and philosophies of the road. Even when Swankie reveals her cancer, she follows with a catalogue of reasons life has been good.The real genius of this road trip is combining the blue-collar heroes with only two recognizable stars, McDormand and David Strathairn as Dave, a potential love interest for her. The feel is it's about white blue-collar retirees surviving and finding friendship, with a couple of real actors (one a multiple Oscar winner) to anchor the aesthetics and imposing landscapes of Arizona, Nevada, South Dakota, and California. With music soft and low, we understand the characters without being manipulated.Nomadland is at least one of the best films of the year because it chronicles road warriors tattered by a thoughtless economy but, like Swankie, still seeing the beauty in a country that fights for its dignity:\"The way I see it is that the Titanic is sinking and economic times are changing.

{"review": "\"Nomadland\" is one moving emotional like drama that gives a grim look at life for one after better times have passed. Director Chloe Zhao made most of the film in a doc like close up feel as it was populated with many real life folks only the acting and interaction does it in small parts and moments of open roads, highways, and a western backdrop that helps give the film a feel of escape as the mood ask for hope. As you watch you see a nouveau West American like dream. As it's like a search for the lost American spirit for many.The movie is made from the performance of Frances McDormand(who's great and super in down to earth blue collar common roles) as Fern a weathered, wrinkled and past her prime middle aged widow who becomes houseless after almost losing it all once her job at her gypsum plant folds up in her local Nevada hometown. Then it's a journey of traveling the West in Fern's high mileage rattle trap Van in which Fern calls home too as she lives with the grid and grind while meeting other nomads(many were real life one's). One thing for certain as you watch you admire the strong will and determination of Fern as after her seasonal job at Amazon goes she still travels and makes the most of it. As the great recession simply will not ruin Fern. Really the theme of the picture can be classified as grim look at our country supposed safety net showing those in middle age have to develop a new journey and destiny seeking means of new hope.Really it's a celebration of real people and folks from stores, diners, rest stops, and a glimpse of wonder by seeing the open roads and beautiful lands of the old American West as this is well on display thru the film. During it all Fern and the others learn and live in the moment all while making connections in the meantime they reflect on the past as this movie for one teaches about loss, yet loving even after work, and family. As overall this film is about moving on and accepting change while remembering your past journey as the new open road and highways have hope and love with closure in the sunset.", "helpfulness": 0.5}
{"review": "'Nomadland (2020)' really is one of those films where 'nothing happens', a slice of life drama focusing on an elderly woman who lives life as a nomad. In reality, of course, plenty of stuff does occur over the course of the narrative. It's just that it doesn't really resemble a traditional plot. The main focus of the flick is the inner journey of its protagonist, which manifests itself as a series of character interactions and, for lack of a better term, set-pieces (though not the kind you may first associate with the term). It's a quiet picture filled with plenty of moments of gentle beauty; it's a serene experience pretty much throughout. On top of that, it's surprisingly engaging. There's never a moment that even comes close to being boring. Having said that, the movie does meander quite a bit. In fact, it's almost all comprised of meandering. Of course, that isn't necessarily a bad thing, considering what the affair aims to achieve. It just means that the thing is only ever so compelling, and that some of its moments seem ever-so-slightly repetitive. Strangely, the more traditional narrative elements (those involving actors other than Frances McDormand) are arguably less effective than the non-traditional aspects. As I understand it, the majority of characters are portrayed by real people who aren't aware that McDormand is acting when she interacts with them. At times, the film is almost like a documentary because of this. There are a couple of moments in which we see people really open up and express themselves in honest, brave and genuinely affecting ways. There's a slight sense of disingenuousness, though, because these people think they're talking to a regular person just like them. It's almost like their testimonials are being solicited, extracted under an icky false pretence (for instance, one man shares a deeply personal and deeply tragic story as a way of empathising with McDormand's own struggle - which, I'll remind you, is entirely fake - in an effort to console her). Still, this issue isn't too detrimental and its impact is actually more on the people directly involved with filming. Ultimately, the movie offers a close and subtly caring look at an underrepresented segment of American culture. It's an effective, understated 'slice of life' drama, but it's very low-key and is only ever so compelling. It won't be for everyone, but it's a worthwhile watch. 6/10.", "helpfulness": 0.2857142857142857}
{"review": "The fact that director Chlo\u00e9 Zhao's 'Nomadland' is nominated for some of the most important categories Academy Awards and that it is even considered the main favorite for the best film of 2020 may have influenced my experience of watching this film. Don't get me wrong. 'Nomadland' is a beautiful and sensitive film, a combination of road movie, documentary and drama that tells a lot about America today, a film that I liked. However, its charm consists in simplicity and sincerity and there is no too much of a story in this film. It looks more like a European film, Agn\u00e8s Varda's 'Sans toit ni loi' ('Vagabond') being the film that comes to my mind now as a term of comparison, than like an American production with a good chance of dominating the Academy Awards ceremony. Academy. It's an anti-Academy movie. Maybe it's exactly the nominations that make some (rather minor) minuses of the film that I might otherwise have ignored stand out. The heroine of the film, Fern (the wonderfulFrances McDormand) is a widow and no longer has a house of her own. She defines herself as 'houseless' and not 'homeless', her game of words indicating that she considers the caravan in which she probably invested her last savings as her home and the roof under which she wants to spend the rest of her life, a mobile home that she uses to drive across America. She is not the only one who chooses this way of life. Same as Fern, who had gone through the tragedy of her husband's illness and death and the ruin of the city built around a mining industry gone dry, there are plenty of other Americans who choose to live a nomadic life by traveling in their caravans on the roads of America, living close to nature and sustaining themselves from temporary and seasonal work. At one point another character tries to put this way of life into words by linking it to the historical epic of American heroes with their pioneering spirit, but Fern seems to reject this rhetoric. The reasons why she chooses this way of life are personal, although maybe not necessarily prosaic. So we are dealing with a road movie, in which the spectators of the film accompany Fern for a year in her journey. This is the America of simple people, of ordinary life situations, of the nature that envelops and overwhelms. I hope that my association will be excused, but some of the situations in the film reminded me the movies featuring Borat, the hero of Sacha Baron Cohen. As there, we are dealing with 'Deep America' and its people, but the approaches are opposite. Cohen seeks (and sometimes provokes) farce and behavioural extremes, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao immerses herself in everyday life and brings to the film the humanity of those she meets. The use of non-professional actors, people who do not act in a film but live their own lives on screen, contributes enormously to the authenticity of the film. Joshua James Richards' cinematography constantly makes the connection between the characters and the social environment (I like the excellent scenes in the Amazon hangars) or the surrounding nature, which is sometimes spectacularly beautiful, other times cold and hostile. The music, belonging to the Italian composer and pianist Ludovico Einaudi, manages to be authentic, beautiful and expressive without ever capturing more attention than necessary. Frances McDormand, who succeeds in every new film in which she appears to give birth to another character, integrates here perfectly into the almost documentary style of the film. Her character being so consistent, I missed a more consistent narrative structure around. For more than two thirds of the film, the actress builds a complex, deep character that triggers empathy and makes us, spectator to ask questions. When the answers come, they seem too mundane. It is here that perhaps the director and screenwriter could have given up simplicity. Anyway, out of the films nominated this year that I've seen so far, 'Nomadland' is my favorite. Let's see if this film with an anti-Academy approach will convince the members of the Academy to award it any of the significant prizes.", "helpfulness": 0.45454545454545453}

So, in desperation and anger, she rents out three billboards and calls the local Police Chief (Woody Harrelson) to task for this.

What happens from there...well, just see the film.There were many wonderful scenes and characters in this picture. But, there were also many main characters who were just god-awful and unlikable...including Mildred!

{"review": "Saw 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' on the promise of one of the year's best trailers, the immensely talented cast, the intriguing subject matter, the receiving and pending of numerous accolades and being familiar with Martin McDonagh's previous work. On the most part 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' was incredibly well done. Understandably it is not for all. The film has already been criticised for implausibility, bigotry, the ending and its lack of character likeability and over-the-top actions, though often without acknowledging the film's many strengths and resorting to condescension (a big bugbear of mine) towards people who liked it let alone loved it. Did have a couple of issues with 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' myself. The ending is far too abrupt and without resolution in a film crying out for one. Epileptics should beware too of a dizzyingly edited attempted murder scene, understand why it was edited that way but will admit that it did make me feel ill watching it (luckily it quickly passed). Abbie Cornish felt out of place here, she doesn't have a lot to do (not enough to single handedly ruin the film, she would have to have a far more major role to do that) but everything about her just jarred. There are some implausible behaviours and consequences, Dixon's actions were more than just a sackable offense for instance.However, there is so much to like about 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri'. With the sole exception of Cornish, who isn't in it enough to ruin the film, the acting is brilliant. Frances McDormand's performance is a career high and one of the year's best, very heartfelt and fiery, even if you don't condone some of her actions it is hard not to feel for her as she goes through every mother's worst nightmare. Woody Harrelson is heart-breaking and has the film's most sympathetic character perhaps (either he or Peter Dinklage's, although Dinklage doesn't have the film's most tragic scene). Sam Rockwell is similarly a revelation, you initially dislike his character but later on his 180 is incredibly moving and he is the character who changes and redeems the most. Peter Dinklage always makes anything better and it's the same here just by his presence alone and his performance is the most likeable one, especially towards the end where one actually feels sorry for him. Another standout is the writing, do not let the heavy use of profanity put you off. There are parts that are darkly comic and induce a number of chuckles and laugh out louds. The film also works as being one that is morally nuanced and complex, the characters are not \"likeable\" ones, neither were they intended to be, and make questionable decisions but they undergo changes that sees them in a different perspective (Dixon especially). A large part of me found it difficult to not relate to Mildred, her actions are extreme at times but there are parents in the same situation that feel similarly seeing as grief is an incredibly powerful and complex emotion. It's the tragic elements that resonate most though, with its heavy going themes handled very poignantly and harrowingly. 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' has a story that is deliberate but also gripping, with an adept balance of its varied tones. Which is why it is sad that it ends as unsatisfyingly as it does. With the exception of one scene, 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is succinctly edited and grittily and beautifully shot. McDonagh directs very skilfully. Carter Burwell's music score fits perfectly and is a hypnotic, understated and melancholic score in its own right. Just as fitting in a somewhat ironic way is the use of the gorgeous \"Last Rose of Summer\" exquisitely sung by Renee Fleming, whose voice one familiar with and loves classical music and opera (like me) recognises from anywhere. Overall, gripping and very well done film if not perfect. The performances are among the best of the year especially but the film itself as an overall whole just falls a tad short of being one of the year's best films. 8/10 Bethany Cox", "helpfulness": 0.6875}

I wonder if Rockwell starts his performing with an American director, he wouldn't be told to take it a different way. His action in the middle of the movie is absolutely crazy. The aftermath needs more expanding rather than a simple firing. I can't believe that he's not locked up. Then his character takes a 180 turn as the movie climaxes. He leaves the movie a two dimensional billboard rather than a fully formed human character. I am much more impressed with Mildred, Willoughby, and their connection. McDormand delivers a driven character of the first order and Harrelson is more human in his reservation. There is real power behind their performances whereas Rockwell is doing a cartoon.

I appreciated that Woody Harrelson's sheriff is not unsympathetic. He is a pretty good guy. He tried to solve the case, but he is right when it comes to finding no clues. By the way, is anyone reading this growing a little tired of the \"F\" word being used in every other syllable of speech. The cops, townspeople, McDormand, on and on, can't say three words without dropping one of these. Is no effort made to create realistic speech among characters?

I went to a supermarket yesterday, filled with all kinds of people, and didn't hear the \"F\" word once. Outside of that, if one accepts the premise of this film, it's tragic to watch this woman in her state of rage and guilt.

With McDormand at the center, saying what she is saying, the mood shifts in an instant from comedy to Harrelson's coughing his lungs out without anyone missing a beat. It's one of those instants in a movie that tells you that these actors are inhabiting these characters who have known each other for decades and draws me into the moment and the story far more than anything else could.I don't know if McDonagh has finally learned how to direct his own material; I suspect that he let McDormand have her own head. Several decades ago, her turn in FARGO had me convinced that Ethan Coen came in one day and said \"Joel, if you don't let Frances play this scene the way she wants, I'm going to be sleeping on the couch for a long time.\"\nI think she understands these characters and can show them, and McDonagh let her have her head.

{"review": "\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" is the fourth directorial effort by British Oscar-winning filmmaker Martin McDonagh and as I must say I am quite a fan of his previous 3 directorial efforts, I cannot deny that my hopes for this one here were pretty high too. Of course, they also were because of the massive deal of awards recognition this has received in the last couple months. It is one of the films that has a shot at taking home Best Picture at the Oscars this year. It runs for slightly under 2 hours and takes us on a journey into the life of Mildred Hayes, who fights the local police department hoping this is gonna speed things up in the difficult task of finding her daughter's killer. The police gets represented by the performances of Rockwell and Harrelson here and Rockwell (like McDormand) seems in a safe spot for an Oscar win too now. There are other known actors in here like Cornish, Ivanek, Dinklage, Hedges, Hawkes etc. But it really is McDormand's film for the most part and I can see why they did not put Rockwell in lead. Still, a shout-out to my man Woody Harrelson who is having another fantastic year with this one and his turn in The Glass Castle. We talked about that one on another occasion already.As for this one here though, his voice-over sequences were among the very best it had to offer. And also the most touching. Hearing his letters that he wrote before his suicide is really heartbreaking stuff, especially the one to his wife, but also the one to Dixon. As for the one to his wife, the comment about how seeing her pain is worse than the privileges of spending a few more days with his daughters is good will easily wet your eyes. The one to Dixon goes well in hand with another really well-written scene as the moment Dixon changes for the better and saves the file from the flames had really so much to offer. In general, I think McDonagh did an amazing job with the writing, especially the dialogue writing. It was spot-on and often also very funny, but dark humor is something you expect here as it is omnipresent in all his previous works too. The ****head that is also in the trailer is among the very best comedic moments of the entire year.Another thing I want to mention about this film is the subject of forgiveness. Of course, Mildred won't forgive the killer of her daughter, but it is a subject that keeps coming back, especially in the second half, be it either the orange juice scene, the scene with Dixon forgiving Mildred for the fire, or both sort of forgiving the other potential killer at the very end inside the car. The film ends the perfect moment, even if it was a bit expected. This is the first moment when we see the central character showing something like forgiveness at all, even before she was not ready to remove the Willoughby billboard despite his death. It's a key to having a happier life again as grief is of course still there, but it is not everything. Dinklage's character (McDonagh sure has it with midget humor) described in one scene nicely how McDormand's character is always sad and negative and this may change in all that happens after the film now that she let forgiveness in her heart to some extent at least. As for Dinklage's character, I liked that they were not really shoving a out-of-nowhere love story in our faces then, but that it ends after the date because of obstacles both characters yet have to overcome. McDonagh also does a great job with realism because honestly having the killer sit coincidentally at the very same pub all of a sudden the very same time that Rockwell's character does would have been a shot of one in a million and nothing remotely authentic. So it's good it was somebody else.There was really not a lot I didn't like in here. The first sentence about torturing blacks that is also featured in the trailer had a bit of Hollywood liberalism written all over it while the n-word and torture fun scene afterwards was pretty hilarious without a doubt. In terms of gay-themed references, the same is true too. Struggling a bit with the inclusion, but solid elaboration. The only scene I really did not like was the flashback sequence when we see the daughter when she was still alive and honestly how they talk about her murder feels really out of place and too big of a coincidence. Then again, it is not elaborated on properly as this could have been fictitious in Mildred's mind as well or it could have been another talk, not the one that directly came before she went off and got killed. So as a whole, I very much enjoyed this film, the cast is outstanding, the script is really really good and the other components like the music, especially the songs used, are top-notch too. I'd be happy if this really wins Best Picture at the Oscars as it would be deserving, one of the best films of the year, not my personal number one, but I highly recommend checking it out and it's a shame McDonagh did not get the Best Director nomination.

{"review": "Martin McDonagh has directed a clever crime drama with black humour which tips a wink to the Coen brothers, although as a writer McDonagh's screenplay also has some holes which are difficult to gloss over.The Coen brothers link is maintained by a powerful bitter performance from Frances McDormand who plays Mildred whose teenage daughter was murdered almost a year earlier an the police have got nowhere with their investigations.Mildred takes matters into her own hands and creates a spark of incendiary dynamite, by hiring three billboards to shame the Ebbing chief of police chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) to action. Her action shocks and shames the small town, the local police do not take well to Mildred's action especially as Willoughby is dying of cancer.Hot headed police officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell) who got away with beating up a black suspect thinks he can bully Mildred, he certainly intimidates the man who rented out the billboards. However he finds that this grieving mother is too hard boiled for him.There is almost a freewheeling style to this film although if you are familiar with McDonagh's previous film, that a lot of it comes together at the end. Despite the bleak subject, there is a lot of humour here as well as tenderness.It is terrifically acted from the main leads, McDormand, Rockwell and Harrelson all vying for Oscar nominations.You also get good performances from other actors in smaller roles such as Caleb Landry Jones as Red the advertising agent who rents the billboards out and gets thrown out of the window for his troubles. Also John Hawkes as Mildred's ex husband who left her for a teenage girl.However you also have outward display of brutality from a serving police officer, a man in a bar who beats up an officer and Mildred who shows signs of violence and no one gets arrested.", "helpfulness": 0.4}
{"review": "\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" is a great crime movie in an environment of grief, anger, remorse, racism, violence, sympathy and a sophisticated black-humor. The performances are top-notch and it is hard to point out only one or two names in the cast, indeed a constellation of stars. Maybe the performances of Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell may be highlighted since they are the lead. Unfortunatelly the deceptive ending without a conclusion throws cold water in this film. The redemption of Dixon finding the rapist killer would have given some hope to the story. But the author decided to keep a dark ending without conclusion. Claude Chabrol was a master in mystery films with open end; however his conclusion were subtle and ambiguous, giving the chance to the audience to discuss possibilities based on his or her interpretation of the storyline. But the conclusion of \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" is indeed a cliffhanger usually used in TV series or films written for franchise or at least a sequence.

{"review": "With a steely resolve similar to Winston Churchill's in \"Darkest Hour\", Frances McDormand knocks it out of the park with her portrayal of an aggrieved mother seeking justice for her murdered daughter in \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\". Before seeing the movie and not knowing what the story was about, I thought the title of the movie was trying to be a bit pretentious and quirky to draw an audience, but all you have to do is see the movie and you'll know that any title would have sufficed for this engaging work from writer and director Martin McDonagh. But it's not only McDormand you need to see here. Woody Harrelson plays somewhat against type as a local chief of police, and his deputy, portrayed by Sam Rockwell, provide a lot to contemplate about intolerance and personal agendas in out of the way, off the beaten path, American small towns. You'll find some of filmdom's most intelligent and creative writing in the letters written by Chief Willoughby (Harrelson) revealed after his death. I have to say, when Willoughby put that gun to his head, and even though you saw it coming, his suicide was the most electrifying moment I've seen on screen since Brad Pitt's character was blown away by George Clooney in \"Burn After Reading\". As the viewer, all you can do is sit up and reorient yourself because it suddenly becomes a different picture. Interestingly, Frances McDormand was in that movie too. So I'm reading some of the other reviews here and it appears that there's some feeling that the movie leans toward dark comedy. I don't know if I can go along with that because the subject matter is entirely serious and most of the characters convey themselves with an appropriate earnest demeanor. One of the things that didn't work for me was Mildred's (McDormand) ex-husband (John Hawkes), carrying on with a teenage girlfriend, but I guess it could happen. Mildred's relationship with James (Peter Dinklage) might have gone off the rails in a different kind of movie but here, things were tastefully handled. I was also troubled by the revelation that the vicious redneck who beat up on Dixon (Rockwell) was exonerated on DNA evidence, a plot point borrowed from 2003's \"Memories of Murder\". But even with some of my personal negatives, I thought this was a brilliant movie, brilliantly made. I think it has a fair chance of garnering a Best Picture Oscar along with a Best Actress for Frances McDormand, although this awards season is probably the strongest in recent memory regarding the competition. It will be interesting to see, but either way, it's a picture I'd recommend anyone to watch. It could very well leave you stunned.", "helpfulness": 0.4}

As a bereaved mother demanding that the police in a small town find out who raped and murdered her daughter, McDormand gives it her all. And boy is it a heavy-duty role! Almost every scene in the movie made me feel as if I was in the scene with the characters (and as if I was walking on eggshells).Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell won well deserved Oscars for their roles (and while accepting her Oscar, McDormand called for inclusion riders to ensure a higher number of women involved in the production of movies). But even ignoring that, this is one impressive movie. The acting, direction, cinematography, and complexity of the characters. The end says that, even though Mildred didn't find her daughter's killer, she had to go after another killer to put herself at rest.An outstanding movie.

{"review": "I was surprised by the amount of bad language featured in just the trailer for this movie, from this I was already wanting to see it, then more so when it was getting nominations during Awards Season, I was hoping for an interesting tragicomedy, from writer and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, The Guard). Basically teenager Angela Barnes (Kathryn Newton) was raped and murdered seven months ago, her mother Mildred (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Frances McDormand) is grieving, but also angry at the lack of progress in the investigation. Driving towards her town, outside of Ebbing, Missouri, she passes three unused billboards, she makes enquiries to Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones) at the company that rents them. She pays for them to read, in sequence, \"RAPED WHILE DYING\", \"AND STILL NO ARRESTS?\", and \"HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY?\" The billboards upset the townspeople, including Sheriff Bill Willoughby (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Woody Harrelson), who the third billboard refers to, and officer Jason Dixon (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Sam Rockwell). The fact that Willoughby suffers from terminal pancreatic cancer adds to their disapproval, Mildred and her depressed son Robbie (Lucas Hedges) are harassed and threatened, but she stays firm, to Robbie's disappointment. While Willoughby is sympathetic to Mildred's frustration, he thinks the billboards are an unfair attack on his character. Dixon is angry at Mildred's lack of respect, he threatens Red, and arrests her friend Denise (Amanda Warren) for insignificant possession of marijuana. Mildred also receives a visit from her abusive ex-husband Charlie (John Hawkes), who blames her for the death of their daughter. Willoughby brings Mildred in for questioning after she has an altercation with her dentist, she injured him with a drill at the clinic. During the interview, Willoughby coughs up blood, against medical advice, he leaves the hospital to spend time an idyllic day with his wife Anne (Abbie Cornish) and daughters, before committing suicide with a gunshot to the head. Before he killed himself, Willoughby wrote several suicide notes for people, including one to Mildred, in which he explains that she was not a factor in his suicide. Willoughby has also secretly paid to keep her billboards up for another month, amused at the trouble it will bring her, a stranger (Brendan Sexton III) soon threatens her in the store she works. Dixon reacts to the news of Willoughby's death by assaulting Red and his assistant, the new chief and Willoughby's replacement Abercrombie (Clarke Peters) witnesses the attack and fires Dixon. Mildred is devastated when passing the billboards to find them on fire, an arson attack, meanwhile Dixon hears that there is a suicide note for him back at the police station. Still in possession of the keys, Dixon enters the police station at night to read the note, which advises him to let go of hate and learn to love so he can achieve his dream of becoming a detective. Dixon is unaware that Mildred is retaliating to destruction of the billboards by tossing bottle bombs at the station, she assumed the building was unoccupied, Dixon escapes the burning building, throwing out Angela's case files, but suffers severe burns. Mildred's acquaintance James (Peter Dinklage) witnessed the incident, but provides Mildred with an alibi to the police, claiming that they were on a date. Dixon is discharged from hospital and goes to a bar, whilst there he overhears the man who threatened Mildred in the store bragging about an incident similar to Angela's murder. Dixon notes the man's car licence plate, he scratches the man's face, provoking a fight, but removes the man's skin from his nails, as a DNA sample to investigate if he had any part in Angela's murder. Meanwhile, Mildred accepts the offer from James to go on a real date, as a thank you for the alibi, but this is spoiled when Charlie enters, with his 19-year-old girlfriend Penelope (Samara Weaving), he admits to burning the billboards, Mildred instructs Charlie to treat Penelope well and leaves. Abercrombie informs Dixon that the DNA sample does not match DNA found on Angela's body, and that the man was on military duty aboard at the time of the murder. Mildred and Dixon conclude that the man must be guilty of some other rape, so they plan to drive to Idaho, carrying a gun, on the way, Mildred confesses to starting the police station fire, Dixon replies without surprise, they both have reservations about their mission, but agree to decide what to do on the way. Also starring Kerry Condon as Pamela, Sandy Martin as Momma Dixon and Christopher Berry as Tony. McDormand gives a brilliant performance as the divorced mother, who tests our sympathies, bankrolling an ad campaign to find her daughter's killer, Rockwell is also fantastic as the dim-witted cop with issues, and Harrelson does well in his time onscreen as the happy-go-lucky sheriff trying to justify himself, whilst also suffering a deadly disease. This is a clever mix of both the funny and the tragic, the high amount of foul language and one-liners are what get the right amount of chuckles, but it is also poignant in its approach to grief, emotional reactions, and other hard-hitting material, it is both sad and funny, a marvellous black comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Score for Carter Burwell, Best Original Screenplay for Martin McDonagh, and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film, Outstanding British Film of the Year, and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, and Best Editing, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Original Score.

{"review": "Seven months after the rape and murder of Mildred Hayes's daughter the police are no closer to catching the killer. One day Mildred drives past three billboards on a quiet road outside town; it doesn't look as if a new advert has been but up in decades. She goes to the advertising agency in town and tells them she intends to hire all three for a year. Her three adverts say: 'Raped While Dying', 'Still No Arrests?', and 'How Come, Chief Willoughby?'. This immediately gets the attention of the police; Willoughby tries to explain that he has done everything he can but the killers DNA doesn't match any on any national database and there are no other leads, he also tells her he has terminal cancer. His deputy, the violent and bigoted Officer Jason Dixon is angrier and starts threatening Mildred and those close to her. Other townspeople don't like being reminded of the incident and side with the police. As tensions rise things get dangerous and people get hurt... but will it bring Mildred any closer to getting justice for her daughter?Having seen adverts for this film it didn't particularly appeal but when I was given the DVD as a present I thought I should watch it. As it turned out I really enjoyed the film. The basic premise was interesting but it was the strength of the main characters that made the film so engrossing; and the fact that the protagonists all seemed flawed but not irredeemable only helped. Frances McDormand was on great form as Mildred Hayes; a woman who, fuelled by a sense of righteous outrage goes to extreme measures. Sam Rockwell is equally good as Dixon; a policeman whose anger is matched by his lack of intelligence and Woody Harrelson impresses as chief Willoughby. The story progresses in ways I wasn't expecting; good characters to bad things and bad characters do good things. Some of the things that happen might not be too realistic but when I watch a drama I want a good story so don't mind the odd lapse from what would really happen if somebody did what characters here get away with. The conclusion might be too open for some viewers but it worked for me. If I have one complaint it is that there is a lot of strong language; enough to put off some viewers who would otherwise be drawn to such a story. Overall I thought this was a really good story and would definitely recommend it.", "helpfulness": 0.0}
{"review": "This movie received lots of Oscar buzz and the actors really are great. My wife and I watched it at home on DVD from our public library.There are a number of writer/directors who relish in angry, profane characters with few redeeming values. This is one of those movies. \nFrances McDormand is Mildred, divorced and angry, mostly because her daughter was raped and killed 7 months earlier and she doesn't think the local police are working hard enough on the case.On the small road to her rural home she notes three old, dilapidated billboards and decides to use them to poke fun at the local police chief, hoping to shame him into working harder on her daughter's case.Sam Rockwell is one of the mostly inept local cops, Dixon. He is a drunk and a hot head. The captain is played by Woody Harrelson as Willoughby. He has a not-so-secret secret, that he is dying from cancer.Ultimately the movie turns into a revenge story, and it doesn't even matter if the revenge is towards the guilty ones.

Things become worse when a pent-up police officer, Dixon (Sam Rockwell) becomes enraged and starts acting out.Lots of swearing, lots of violence, and lots of laughs to be had in this film. It was strange to watch as I had just seen another film, Past Life, that focused on the subject of anger and pain, and how it can eat a person up and destroy them. This film is yet another good illustration of that, as Mildred stops at nothing to make a point.The one-liners are amazing, and Mildred's speech to the priest who comes by to ask her to remove the billboards is hilarious. The movie is filled with strong performances and equally well-developed characters. We see all of their sides - violent, kind, vengeful, angry, sad; we finally realize they're just people driven in some cases to extremes.Harrelson's performance is touching -- we're prepared to dislike him but his sincerity and humanity come through. As Dixon, Rockwell seems like a monster, but once he acts out, he's able to focus his energy a little better.And then there's McDormand, a powerhouse. She's not good ol' Marge in Fargo.

{"review": "It takes not only a considerable amount of skill to match deep-dark- heartbreaking dramatic storytelling and characters with a pitch\ud83d\ude28black comic edge; to go the extra mile one should hopefully have a voice. Martin McDonaugh may be mistaken too quickly as having made a Coen brothers film - Frances McDormand being there doesn't help assuage that argument - yet through In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths he's shown his acidic, no bullish*t, I see clich\u00e9s for what they are and raise you a subversion original voice in writing and an assured hand in direction. He also casts his movies like nobody's business and from McDormand down to Sam Rockwell and Sam Rockwell's mom to the actress as Angela Hayes having one scene, he has everyone with fresh, Thanksgiving-buffet-plate meat to chew on. While it's one of the best films of the year, I'm sure if I try, more or less, I can find some nitpick or even flaws - the daughter Hayes scene could be one simply for the final two lines mother and daughter have, I understand the point but it's too far on the nose, especially for this artist; another could be how quickly \"f***head\" Rockwell comes around to a kind-of-sort-of-maybe redemption in the third act - but all of this is overshadowed by the giant moral and social-political-emotional scope of everything else. Mildred Hayes is one of those movie characters that, male or female (but especially make), stays with you for not so much how balls they are but how marvelled they are by their own ballsiness.McDormand has such a command of the character in the big moments - those trailer bits that, if ones been going to the movies this year, has been overplayed (though luckily practically all of the major story points aren't revealed) - one may miss a moment like when Mildred realizes a character did something horrible that she punished someone else for, or how she looks after a tough a-hole comes into her shop coming face to face with a threatening countenance. She's played so many people who carry an ocean of complexity but whats appealing is how she carries a lot of it without needing to show much. Hell, one beat where she has her two animal slippers on their feet talk in bold violent terms is among the great acting moments of the year. So how relevant is it to now? I mention Do the Right Thing because not so much it having the same dramatic build up so much as it has a similar anger - no sorry not true, boiling, scornful rage - at how segments of our country have been, are and may always be (the mother of Rockwell is one such character who inspires such rage at least for me, and she is just your average white-bread matriarch. Also like Lee's film it shows a community who are inextricably linked, and at times the stark racism is almost like a bad joke (Rockwell's cop being a torturer of black inmates, if not more than one, is almost a goof; he's akin to the John Tururro type in DtRT, a man who just is what he is and it's too late to change now, so everyone looks at Mildred in this story and her whole billboards \"thing\" closer to something like a basic acting-out in grief than a howl for justice. And then when it comes time for a new man to come in to the town's police force, and I won't say how or why, and id rather you just see it than me put in the spoiler marker, it is like a cold bath of irony: the genuinely tough, decent, on top of it older black man. This is as towering a script as we may get in American cinema this year, and if it has imperfections it shouldn't matter much. The central idea here is such: if you don't bring a light on stark injustice, people wont do much if nothing else because it's not on their mind or (frankly) in their own interests. Willoughby says at one point the billboards are a \"chess move.\" What is the \"king\" to take then? The ending of the film may seem to leave things too open-ended for some, and I get that. To me, the end is that there's never an ending when it comes to looking at rape (which is assault) and other violence (which is more directly assault) there is no clear ending.

{"review": "Raiders of the Lost Ark marked the debut of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, two fisted archaeologist with a mean bull whip. The film also reawakened a longing in the American public for some good old fashioned pulp fiction adventure even if it is done tongue slightly in cheek.Archeology certainly is a competitive business, but I think Indiana Jones takes it to an exponential level. He certainly has to when he's dealing with the up and coming German Reich. What they and Jones are after is high stakes indeed. Both have a lead on where the Ark of the Covenant might be buried. It was spirited away after the destruction of the second temple in Jerusalem, whereabouts unknown until the 1930s. As the Good Book tells us the Kingdom of Israel was undefeated as long as the Ark was ahead of them in battle. So even with the Nazis rather well known policy about Jews, they'd like to have this thing with whatever powers it has.It's a pretty delicate matter. If you remember a soldier of King David was struck down for just touching the Ark as it was about to fall. You can catch that in the Gregory Peck-Susan Hayward film, David and Bathsheba. It should definitely come with a warning label. Anyway, Ford ably assisted by Karen Allen, Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies goes after it and has to battle the Nazis for possession. As for the Nazis, it's like that old adage of being careful what you wish for.Raiders of the Lost Ark was nominated for several Oscars and came away with a few in the 1982 ceremony for 1981's films.

This was my first time watching this in God knows how many years and while I didn't enjoy it as much as I remembered I still had a good time with it, although I still think Spielberg has made much better films. What I loved most (and this might be clich\u00e9) is the amazing throwback to the early serials of the 30's and 40's. It's clear that the screenplay is going for that type of adventure and Spielberg's direction really hits all the right marks as we go on an adventurous ride that takes us from various countries and throws the hero into all sorts of obstacles. There are countless classic scenes here from the running from the huge rock to the gun/sword scene and the wonderful pit of snakes. The screenplay certainly throws just about everything into the mix and having Hitler be the bad guy just adds a lot of pulp fun. I'm really not sure why I didn't love this movie like many others do but I'm going to take a guess and say that the over the top adventure was just a little too much to me. Outside the classic scenes in the film, whenever the movie pauses to do something not involving a stunt, I just found it somewhat boring.

{"review": "Stephen Spielberg and George Lucas - once, two fine directors before they \"sold out\" to the masses - teamed up to create this outstanding adventure movie which brings back the classic days of the cliffhanging serials, with an intrepid hero, exotic locations, and lots of escapes from deadly traps and villains. RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is a film blessed with brilliant action sequences - some of the best ever put to film in my opinion - and plenty of jokes and comic relief (a little too much, actually) to make it fun to watch. Add in a great cast of fresh and veteran performers, one of the most memorable theme tunes ever and a plot which takes in locations including Brazil and Egypt and concerns the mystical Ark of the Covenant, and what you have is a genuinely pleasing blockbuster of a movie.I remember watching all three films in the trilogy and loving them as a kid, as well as being terrified and having nightmares in some instances (and who's to blame me, with all those POLTERGEIST-style rotting corpses dropping on Karen Allen in that dank tomb?). The adrenaline flows during the fluid, excellently-choreographed action scenes, which, like in John Woo's films, are almost balletic in approach. I'm talking about the classic opening shots (which beats the entire TOMB RAIDER movie hands down, and probably inspired the original game) of Indy stealing a jungle idol and getting chased by a huge rolling boulder; the exceptional fist-fight between Indy and scary-looking Pat Roach by a rotating plane, and a fine set-piece involving Indy boarding a moving truck. There are lots of other bits in there too, but those are my favourite moments.Harrison Ford stars in his most famous and best role and has Indy's character spot on. He's dependable, charismatic, handsome, heroic, brave and, best of all, very human: a character even the most cowardly of viewers can identify with. The strong supporting cast is also very good, with Paul Freeman memorably slimy as Belloq; Karen Allen as the slightly annoying female lead/love interest Marion (nothing compared to the irritating blonde in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM though); Ronald Lacey as the supremely villainous trench coated Nazi Toht, John Rhys-Davies as cuddly aide Sallah, and minor parts for Alfred Molina, Denholm Elliot and others.Seen today, as an adult, what I most admire is Spielberg's refusal to pander to a young audience. Yes, the film is violent, with bloody deaths and people being brutally shot and injured. There's also refreshingly little sentimentality here - just constant breathtaking thrills and spills. Incidentally, the film was apparently a big hit in Italy, where directors were quick to rip it off for a whole sub genre of their own (HUNTERS OF THE GOLDEN COBRA, anyone?). Even whole individual scenes were lifted for the likes of TEASURE OF THE FOUR CROWNS, with a boulder-rolling escape for the hero, and LIGHT BLAST, with its memorably gooey melt-deaths copying the fantastic ones in this film. I still remember when I caught this on daytime telly a few years back and was disgusted to find that the shots of Freeman, Lacey and co. melting had been cruelly excised - surely top-quality special effects should be celebrated, not hidden away to avoid scaring youngsters. I was scared, and I'm still glad of it!", "helpfulness": 0.4}
{"review": "Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is an action adventurer college professor. His nemesis is Dr. Belloq (Paul Freeman). When his mentor Ravenwood disappears, the American government recruits Indy in a race against Belloq working for Hitler to find the legendary Ark of the Covenant. They fear the Ark as an invincible weapon. He travels to Nepal to find Ravenwood where he is joined by old flame Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen).Steven Spielberg and George Lucas collaborate on one of the most fun franchise ever made. It is a return to an old fashion action adventure. This has all the right ingredients, and the master chefs to put them all together. It has a great action hero with Ford at his best. He is basically a book smart Han Solo. There is the sassy love interest. Add in all the fun action they could shake a stick at. Mix it all together with expert hands, and it becomes cinematic magic. It also doesn't hurt to get a win over the Nazis.", "helpfulness": 0.4}
{"review": "I used to run home after school to see those awful (technically) Flash Gordon episodes that were hosted by some guy from the television station who made an extra 25 bucks a week to pretend that these were real.  It was exciting.  It was gripping.  But mostly, it wasn't that good.  \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is what those serials would have been with a great story and the money to do what needed to be done.  I know so much has been said.  My two cents' worth is.  A great character, one with incredible determination but human failings, a wonderful female sidekick with whom he has a history. A series of magnificent \"hopeless\" situations.  Nazis.  A mystical object from the Bible.  Pacing that is exquisite.  One narrow scrape after another. Broken ribs.  Carrying on with broken ribs.  Just enough of the supernatural to make for a good conclusion (although, how do the heroes know that you're not supposed to look at things), though the majority of the film is about real people in the most insane maze of events.  I saw this in the theater the second day it was out.  It hadn't had the hoopla that the Star Wars movies had had.  I came out of it feeling so excited that someone in the movie industry could spin such a tail and conclude it in the most satisfying way.  I would love it if when adventure movies were made, that someone could keep a sense of humor once in a while and let these fine actors put life into wonderful characters.", "helpfulness": 0.0}
{"review": "With all the Broadway versions of spectacles coming out now, I was just wondering how a musical version of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" would go over, music by John Williams (possibly based upon all his involvements with Spielberg) and lyrics, of course, by me... With that said, there is a tongue-in-cheek quality about \"Raiders\" and its follow-ups which has caught my intention and probably many others familiar with the great movie serials of the 1930's and 40's. \"Raiders\", of course, was influenced by that (and possibly some of Universal's old Maria Montez/Sabu movies), and in the summer of 1981, this is the movie that every teenager in America had to see and older audiences went to see with great nostalgia in their hearts because of the memories it brought back for them.Harrison Ford IS Indiana Jones, and nobody else could have done this part quite so well. He takes the role seriously, even though there is a glint of smugness in his eyes that he knows the role he's playing will give him screen immortality. Of course, there are four sides of Indiana-the college professor longing for life outside the classroom, the adventurer who is willing to go anywhere as long as he doesn't run into snakes, the romancer who always seems to end up with the wrong woman, and as we learned in \"The Last Crusade\", the son of Sean Connery who always longed for something greater with his father and finally got it.This first edition rightly got a ton of Oscar Nominations, including Best Picture, and made a ton of money. Being one of the few Best Picture nominees to actually be a blockbuster, \"Raiders\" takes its viewers on a ride from which they will want to return again and again. The Lost Ark is, of course, the Ark of the Covenant, and therefore, the film has a ton of religious references. Nasty Nazi's (lead by urbane Paul Freeman) are after it, believing it will give Hitler (and thus the Nazi party) divine power. But Indiana, learning the hard way about Nazi evils, is determined to stop them at any cost, even if it means being trapped in tombs with cobras, asps, rattlers and all sorts of poisonous vipers. Oh, did I mention that there were snakes there, too? His lady friend here is Karen Allen, a tough cookie whose first scene has her punching him out. She's a raspy voiced broad who has seen a thing or two in life and lived to tell about it. She's the type who lives up to \"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger\", and thus, she's a good match for Ford's Indiana. What happened after the plot line was concluded here and the fourth entry (25 years later) was left up to the viewer's imagination. No other woman in between those two films could compare with her.In addition to Freeman as the Nazi is the very creepy looking Ronald Lacey who is obviously based upon 30's and 40's characters played by Peter Lorre, and his presence is unforgettable. Such memorable character actors as John Rhys Davies and Denholm Elliott add to the fun of the film, with a young Alfred Molina in a smaller role. Even though he doesn't appear in the film, Spielberg's presence is felt throughout, and when you mention this and some of his other films, you think of him before you think of any of the actors. The special effects are outstanding and the score is so magnificent that it sounds even great in symphonies, such as the one I saw years ago at the Hollywood Bowl conducted by Mr. John Williams himself.", "helpfulness": 0.5}

{"review": "Thirty years on and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" still packs a punch as a rousing adventure movie. From the opening boulder attack to the exciting Nazi truck chase scene, the film takes the viewer from one harrowing encounter to the next without skipping a beat, presenting it's protagonist, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) as the adventure serial hero come to life fifty years after the genre was born. Exotic locales and desert sands create a foreign mystique that have often been duplicated, but never topped in American action flicks.I recall seeing the movie when it first came out, and how fresh and dramatic it appeared on screen at the time. When Indy was confronted by the sword wielding Arab and simply shot him, I remember thinking - yes, how sensible and effective. No overblown theatrics or inane hand to hand combat, just drop the villain where he stands and get on with it. One of the problems I always had with confrontations like this as a kid was the back and forth dialog between the hero and the bad guy before they actually square off. Not so with Indy, a practical combatant when it comes to saving one's neck.And how about that snake pit? That scene easily passes the test as one of the creepiest sequences going. Doesn't just the sight of a simple garter snake slithering on the lawn startle the heck out of you? So picture yourself in a den with hundreds around you - heart attack material right there for sure.You know, I've seen easily a few hundred Westerns in my time, and one of the signature moves of that genre is the buckboard chase scene made famous by second unit director Yakima Canutt. It's the one where he drops down underneath a stagecoach or wagon and holds on to the underside, making his way to the back of the coach before letting go. Indy does it here during the truck chase scene, and the first thing I thought was what a great tribute to Yak that was. Very well done, requiring perfect timing and nerves of steel.Since this first film in the series came out, I've seen and enjoyed the others, but as is the case most of the time, it's the original that holds sway as the best for being the one that started it all. Indiana Jones will remain a cinema icon for a long time, and he might have given us all an insight into the freshness and originality of his character when in another one of his desperate moments, he casually replies - \"I'm making this up as I go\"!", "helpfulness": 0.5}

{"review": "This is the first of the great trilogy by a great director, Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Steven Spielberg (Jaws, E.T. the Extra- Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan). Harrison Ford (originally meant to be Tom Selleck) stars as Indiana Jones, a hero with a felt hat and a whip. The film begins with a great scene where Indy tries to get an ancient gold statue. Then obviously the main story comes, some U.S. government have heard that the German Nazis (oh, this is 1936, during World War II) are searching for religious artefacts in Cairo, more prominently the Lost Ark (the Ark of the Covenant, the chest that carried the Ten Commandments). It is Indy's job to stop them from getting this Ark, otherwise they could unleash an unnatural force that can probably wipe out anything and everything. Indy is accompanied by his past girlfriend Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) who has something to get him started with his search. He doesn't know it yet, but the man mainly responsible for helping out and leading this dig, along with French Major Arnold Toht (Ronald Lacey), is his old enemy (the one who nicked his gold statue), Dr. Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman). What follows is obviously lots of gun play, a lot of German Nazis, some explosions and a little bit of fantasy. Also starring John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, BAFTA nominated Denholm Elliott as Dr. Marcus Brody, Alfred Molina as Satipo and Wolf Kahler as Colonel Dietrich. This is a fantastic start to the great trilogy, the third film is still my favourite, but you must see the one that started it all.

{"review": "All three Indiana Jones stories were entertaining but this first one was still the best. I would think most people would agree with me on that. They would also agree this film has some very memorable scenes, famous scenes - like the opening one with the gigantic boulder chasing Harrison Ford - to the ending scene with the Ark of the Convenant opened - that will be Hollywood classics for years. In fact, to sum it all up: hundreds of years from now, I wouldn't be surprised if this is still considered one of the great adventure films of all time.The action scenes are varied, which means a lot. You don't get the same kind of jolt of adventure. You get fist fights, battles with snakes, with airplane propellers, guns, knives, poison dates, fires, supernatural plague-type winds, chases through city streets, caves, mountains....you name it, it's all in here. This movie can wear you out, which is almost a negative. The music can get too loud, the action too much, Karen Allen's mouth too profane; the credibility too much to believe, the theology too weird, etc, but no one can deny this is a fun ride all the way through. You take none of it seriously and just enjoy the adventure.Coming on the heels of Star Wars, this really made Harrison Ford a mega-star.

{"review": "Original, exciting, and lots of fun. Spielberg directed it and Kasdan and Lucas wrote it. Without it, we wouldn't have had \"Romancing the Stone\", \"The Jewel of the Nile,\" \"The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Empire\", and many others too numerous to list. They were all more or less rip offs of this one. Of course the original was highly successful. I dragged my lugubrious ex to the theater and even SHE enjoyed it. For a while there was an attempt to merchandise Indiana Jones' leather jackets, fedoras, and bull whips but they didn't get far.The fact that this was such a commercial blockbuster raised the inevitable question, which may be roughly phrased as, \"What do I do NOW, Ma?\" What you do is produce sequels: \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,\" \"Indiana Jones and the Amazon Women of the Moon,\" and so on. Each imitation, each sequel, was less innovative and more desperate and sloppy, but that's in the nature of decadence.Harrison Ford, whose career this put the stamp of approval on, is an archaeologist who is recruited to find the Ark of the Covenant hidden somewhere in the Middle East. It's 1936 and the Nazis are after it and who knows what havoc they might wreak with its powers? Jones drags along Karen Allen, a former lover and assistant, to provide a pulchritudinous sidekick with whom he can exchange insults. Anything resembling sex is out of the question, though, just as it would never have been considered in one of the 1930s Saturday afternoon theater serials on which this kind of story is based.Here's the schematic diagram of the plot: Introduction, suspense, action, suspense, action, suspense . . . n. Then the climax -- a really BIG action scene.But the thing that made it successful and keeps it so enjoyable after thirty years is that the action wasn't of the usual sort. Oh, sure, Jones and his girl friend are threatened with immanent death lots of times -- involved in comic fist fights, shot at with poisoned arrows. That's de rigeur. But how often does a hero find himself dashing through an underground tunnel downhill pursued by a three-ton rolling marble? Another element that contributed to its appeal was its reconstruction of the period, 1936. The exotic settings of 1936 aren't just rebuilt. They're lovingly reproduced. The ordinary set dressings are there to suggest the exotic -- always look for beaded curtains -- but the men don't waltz around in immaculate double-breasted white suits and pith helmets. The settings are overblown, to be sure. I strongly doubt that in all of Nepal there was a saloon with the size and atmosphere of Karen Allen's. I'm not at all sure there were ANY saloons in Nepal in 1936. But they're meant to suggest authenticity, not embody it, and they succeed in an creative way.Finally, the characters are kind of enjoyable in themselves, from the often frightened and only barely willing Indiana Jones himself, through the cartoon Nazis with the monocles and Swastika armbands. Oh, boy, watch the ark of the covenant MELT them down to nothing while they are frozen in place and screaming! The force unleashed.", "helpfulness": 0.64}

{"review": "Inspired by the movies and serials enjoyed by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas in their youth, Raiders Of The Lost Ark is a relentless roller-coaster of a film that sees the bearded movie moguls expertly combining action, romance, horror, adventure, fantasy and comedy; as far as pure entertainment value goes, it doesn't get much better than this.Unlike in their later adventures for Harrison Ford's heroic archaeologist, the pair pitch the level of escapism perfectly, stretching believability to the limits occasionally, but never exceeding them (there's no flying fridges or death defying falls over a cliff in a rubber dinghy in this one). Apart from seriously underestimating the weight of gold (Indy even takes some sand out of the bag he uses to replace a solid gold idol) and expecting the audience to accept that a U-Boat would travel hundreds of miles without submerging, the film is pretty flawless, with classic scene after classic scene brilliantly executed by a Spielberg in his prime.Not yet in his forties, Harrison Ford is still young enough to give the character his all (mind you, being well into his sixties today doesn't seem to have stopped him trying), and he is given able support by a solid cast that includes John Rhys-Davies as brave Egyptian Sallah, Denholm Elliott as fellow history nut Dr. Marcus Brody, Paul Freeman as reprehensible archaeologist Dr. Ren\u00e9 Belloq, and Karen Allen as Jones's spunky sidekick Marion Ravenwood. As well as terrific performances, the film also boasts superb old-school stunts (ie., pre-CGI), excellent visual effects from Richard Edlund, and even some delightfully gruesome moments that might prove too much for some little ones: a man is impaled on spears, a German soldier is reduced to a red mist by propeller blades, faces are melted, and there is even an exploding head!!!

It is the first film in the Indiana Jones franchise. It pits Indiana Jones against a group of Nazis who search for the Ark of the Covenant because Adolf Hitler believes it will make their army invincible. The film co- stars Karen Allen as Indiana's former lover, Marion Ravenwood; Paul Freeman as Indiana's nemesis, French archaeologist Ren\u00e9 Belloq; John Rhys-Davies as Indiana's sidekick, Sallah; and Denholm Elliott as Indiana's colleague, Marcus Brody.Indiana Jones is no ordinary archaeologist. When we first see him, he is somewhere in the Peruvian jungle in 1936, running a booby-trapped gauntlet to fetch a solid-gold idol. He loses this artifact to his chief rival, a French archaeologist named Belloq, who then prepares to kill our hero. In the first of many serial-like escapes, Indy eludes Belloq by hopping into a convenient plane. So, then: is Indiana Jones afraid of anything? Yes, snakes. The next time we see Jones, he's a soft-spoken, bespectacled professor. He is then summoned from his ivy-covered environs by Marcus Brody to find the long-lost Ark of the Covenant. The Nazis, it seems, are already searching for the Ark, which the mystical- minded Hitler hopes to use to make his stormtroopers invincible. But to find the Ark, Indy must first secure a medallion kept under the protection of Indy's old friend Abner Ravenwood, whose daughter, Marion (Karen Allen), evidently has a \"history\" with Jones. Whatever their personal differences, Indy and Marion become partners in one action- packed adventure after another, ranging from wandering the snake pits of the Well of Souls to surviving the pyrotechnic unearthing of the sacred Ark.A joint project of Hollywood prodigies George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, with a script co-written by Lawrence Kasdan and Philip Kaufman, among others, Raiders of the Lost Ark is not so much a movie as a 115-minute thrill ride.But this is the kind of movie that, even today, audiences immediately fall in love with.

It has been analysed, deconstructed, praised and written about at length by everyone from the highest of film critics to the man of the street film lover and his dog. Truth is, is that nothing new can be added to the millions of tomes written about what Spielberg coyly announced was his B movie homage to adventure serials of the 30s and 40s.In simple factoid terms it was roughly made for $20 million and went on to make nearly $400 million! It quickly pulled Spielberg out of a depressive rut after the critical mauling of his period comedy movie 1941. It announced Harrison Ford as a superstar actor whilst simultaneously introducing pop culture references that still thrive today. It won four Oscars and was nominated for a further four, and as it made archaeology sexy it heralded the opening of a new era for the summer blockbuster. The whole production (apart from Spielberg) were taken ill whilst filming in Tunisia and it was the start of a franchise that still brings great GREAT pleasures to millions of fans.Why is Raiders so adored? That it is a film that still entertains royally today, where once loved in 1981 is still loved by the very same older and wiser people in the new millennium? The answer is it gets everything right, it transcends its basic source to reveal one of the most exhilarating action/adventure movies ever made. It's packed with outstanding action set-pieces (amazing stunt-work), the special effects stunning, the locations are sumptuous, the cinematography gorgeous and Williams' score stirs the blood and raises the gooseflesh. The narrative is smooth and appealing in its good versus bad race against time simplicity, yet the pace is frenetic. From the establishment of the kinetic pleasures with its iconic opening section, to the gloriously gruesome finale, it's breakneck stuff that is by turns intense but played with considerable wit and playfulness.Casting is also spot on, with Ford leading the way. Ford's performance as Indiana Jones - part time teacher, part time lovable rogue who lurches from one perilous situation to another - is note perfect. It's a performance of style and substance that is often wrongly ignored by the stuffy, purely because of the genre of film it sits in. That Ford oozes comic book heroics without falling into campy clich\u00e9 is a great achievement, while of course he gave us iconography unbound that still exists today. The supporting performances are also outstanding, with Allen's spunky hard drinking Marion and Freeman's weasel Nazi stooge Belloq particularly hitting the heights. While on the other side of the camera and at the writing table, the trio of Spielberg, Kasdan and Lucas prove to be a meeting of classical adventure loving heart and minds, for the film is crafted with humour, energy and skill. It undoubtedly owes a debt to olde Hollywood fare like Gunga Din, Secret of The Incas and Valley of the Kings (and more), while some stereotyping of natives exists because the film harks back to olde Hollywood adventure movies! And undeniably it's a teeny\u2013tiny bit annoying that as we enter the home straight Allen's character arc has her shift from tough dame to \"save me Indy\" fodder, but small complaints be damned. This is top line genre film making, where true love is proved to always last a lifetime, because, quite simply, Raiders of the Lost Ark is still the modern day template for action/adventure movies. 10/10", "helpfulness": 0.5384615384615384}
{"review": "I noticed that one reviewer gave this film a score of 1. I just don't get this, as \"Gravity\" is one of the most creative and visually striking films I've ever seen. The only film that reminds me of it, somewhat, is \"Avatar\"--where an entire world is created digitally--much like in \"Gravity\". However, \"Gravity\" is very much unlike \"Avatar\" is most every other way and represents an interesting 'what if' scenario in this near-future sci-fi film.The date in which the film is set is uncertain but is sometime in the near future. In this near future, the International Space Station is still in use, the Chinese Space Station is up and running and the Americans once again have a shuttle program.The film begins with an American space mission in progress. A scientist (Sandra Bullock) is working on fixing her pet space project while being overseen by an experienced astronaut (George Clooney). Without warning, a series of explosions emanating from a Russian satellite create a chain effect--launching space debris everywhere and destroying the shuttle and severely damaging the two nearby space stations. Unfortunately, at this point only the two astronauts are left alive--but not for long unless truly extraordinary events take place that allow them to return to Earth.I was worried that I'd find the film boring. After all, 13 minutes into the movie, you are left with two living characters--and you see no others for the duration of the film. Yet, inexplicably, the script and direction keep the film from being dull. There are no lulls--and the action and acting really work well together and suck you into the film. I have rarely felt as tense as I did as I watched the movie and many times I found myself moving about in my seat along with the action.Technically, the film was amazing. Using the actors' faces, a CG world was created that looked real. You really felt that it was filmed in space and the physics were really awesome. I rarely use words like 'awesome' or 'amazing' in my reviews--but this IS the only way to describe the technical prowess of the film. While I am sure physicists and rocket scientists could spot a few flaws here and there, the film makes it all seem so plausible and real that I cannot help but admire and love the film.Do yourself a favor--see this film and try to see it on the big screen.", "helpfulness": 0.59375}
{"review": "To me, 'Gravity' may not quite the masterpiece that it has been touted to be, though the critics and positive reviews do a fantastic job summing up the film's merits. However, while it is easy to see why some won't like it it is nowhere near as bad from personal opinion as the negative reviewers say. It is nowhere near the worst film ever and not deserving of a 1/10 rating with the visuals, effects and direction being such an achievement, the trend to bash critics and those who agree with the general consensus has also become extremely annoying.Alfonso Cuaron is is an extremely talented director, all his films to date have proved that. 'Children of Men' is especially good and one of the best films of the decade, have always have had a huge soft spot for 'A Little Princess', 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' is not for everyone but for me it was a near-masterpiece, 'Prisoner of Azkaban' is one of the best directed films of the 'Harry Potter' franchise and as polarising as 'Gravity' is there is no denying that Cuaron's direction and the visuals were exceptional. 'Gravity' may be my second least favourite film of his, with 'Prisoner of Azaban', still very good, faring least, this is saying little and is testament to Cuaron's talent.'Gravity' does fall short of perfection. Its weak spot is the script, it does tend to ramble, feel manufactured and cheesy and doesn't do an awful lot to make the characters more than mere clich\u00e9s. The story doesn't always grip with a few slow, dull spots, and the ending puzzles.However, as said already in this review and by previous reviews (acknowledged in most less than positive postings, 'Gravity' is a triumph visually and technically. The cinematography is tremendous, quite possibly the most beautiful and best shot film of 2013. The setting is striking and the special effects are a marvel. Cuaron's direction is exceptional, some of the best he has ever done, a master of visuals and mood.With that being said, 'Gravity' has much more to it than the visuals and direction. The music is an incredible fit, it's haunting, sweeping and breathtakingly beautiful. A good deal of the story is gripping, with intimacy, tension and great emotional impact.Sandra Bullock gives one of her finest performances here and gives the film a certain grace, while George Clooney has a cool calmness that fits his role perfectly. Ed Harris is also impressive.Overall, an achievement visually, technically and directorially, but despite its faults 'Gravity' is much more than those things. 8/10 Bethany Cox", "helpfulness": 0.8}
{"review": "Gravity (2013) **** (out of 4) Visual masterpiece about an astronaut (George Clooney) and a medical engineer (Sandra Bullock) who must try to find a way to survive in space after an accident leaves them cut-off from everything. GRAVITY does a lot of great things and it also puts to rest the whole notion of not watching movies in a theater. Those saying \"I'll wait for the Blu-ray\" are going to be missing quite the experience because this is a film that was born to be seen on the big screen and in 3D.There's really no way that any words can pay justice to the special effects in this film but I guess I'd say that watching this movie is the closest most people will ever get to experiencing outer space. I was really amazed at how wonderful the special effects are as they certainly live up to the hype. It seems every month movie goers get more \"hype\" about something grand but I think it's safe to say that the effects here are perhaps the greatest that you're ever going to see and not too many movies have used effects to such an advantage. I think this entire movie would fall apart if even for a split second you didn't feel as if you were with these characters, all alone and in space. The idea is terrifying on its own but the way the film turns this into an adventure is something quite amazing to watch.It's also rather amazing at how simple but powerful the story is. As the short running time moves along we're told bits and pieces about the Bullock character and when everything plays out it's certainly an incredibly touching and emotional ride. Given the right material Bullock can be truly great and this here is without question the greatest work of her career. She's certainly limited in the movements that the character can do so she must act with her eyes and she does a masterful job. Clooney is also very effective bringing his calm and cool nature to the role, which so perfectly plays well against the other character who is in a panic. I'm certainly not going to ruin how things play out but the entire film just leaves you in a state of drama from the opening scene to the closing. There's no question that GRAVITY will be remembered for decades to come. So, if you think waiting around for this is a smart idea, buy the hype, buy the ticket and witness something truly remarkable.", "helpfulness": 0.4166666666666667}
{"review": "Another overrated Hollywood movie. From all the press and awards it received, you'd think GRAVITY was some kind of masterpiece, but in fact it turns out to be a lightly-plotted space adventure which loses steam about halfway through and becomes tiresome. Yes, the film features some exceptionally fluid camera-work which looks fantastic at times, and it has some of the most realistic space scenes in it yet. The CGI effects work is often flawless and only looks fake in the occasional explosion scene in which it threatens to overwhelm the camera. I didn't mind the storyline too much either, even though it was overly simplistic.Where GRAVITY falls flat is in the choice of lead actress. Sandra Bullock is in no way, shape, or form, a dramatic actress, and yet the viewer is stuck with her character for 100% of the running time. She screams, swears, mouth breathes, and hyperventilates throughout, while her character is responsible for some of the dumbest things in the movie. Why must American films have such horrible lead characters, ones that it's impossible to like, let alone identify with? Bullock's terrible acting drags this film's enjoyment factor right down, despite all the stuff the film-makers get right elsewhere.George Clooney is much better in support but gets little screen time. And after a while you start to spot the artificiality of the script, with Bullock narrowly avoiding destruction time and time again thanks to the machinations of the writers. It seems that she possesses some kind of protective force field, but when she escapes disaster for the umpteenth time the sense of realism is lost. I like Alfonso Cuaron as a director, but perhaps he should forget about trying to write his films as well and start casting better actors.", "helpfulness": 0.45}

Like so many films that are of this genre, we have to look at the likelihood of a single person being able to accomplish what she does. Just the punishment she takes would be enough to squash most mortals. She is smashed against bulkheads, caught in webs of detritus, oxygen starved, burned and frozen, but never into submission. I guess I can't criticize her surviving since in the story she does. There is also her ability to adapt to a setting (a Russian space ship) where she seems to know an awful lot. Granted, she is an astronaut, but her ability to adapt is beyond the pale. All that said, it's a thrill-a-minute science fiction thriller with two charismatic actors (a bit of the supernatural as well).

{"review": "Gravity is Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's first feature movie in seven years. He got help here with the screenplay from his son Jon\u00e1s and also from the film's co-star George Clooney, one of only two actors we see in the film. The other is Sandra Bullock as the undisputed lead and there's occasionally some voice acting, by Ed Harris and others. Harris' inclusion may or may not have to do with his fine work in \"Apollo 13\". The story is summarized very quickly: Bullock and Clooney end up in an accident in space and are confronted with the difficult task of making it back to Earth alive.My favorite section of the film was definitely the first 30 minutes. It's basically that part of the film where Clooney and Bullock share the screen and Clooney elevates those scenes considerably. His critics say he always gets typecast and only shows the same shtick over and over again. (Strangely, for other actors, that is considered smart role selection.) I strongly disagree. He almost always gives multilayered performances and is rarely overshadowed by somebody else in the cast acting-wise although he's been in films with almost all the big names. And let's not forget how he's been writing, directing and producing quality films for a long time. No surprise he's the Academy's darling right now and deservedly so. He's also the best thing about this movie, together with the visual aspects of course. This film could very well dominate these categories at the Oscars and it looks like Emmanuel Lubezki could finally end up with his first Oscar. Anyway, I wrote before that the first half of the movie is my favorite and that's true, mainly because of Clooney who totally nails his lighter scenes (taking away the tension) as well as his dramatic work after the accident. Another reason is that in there we basically see people out in space all the time and it's just mesmerizingly beautiful. If it had gone on like that, this would certainly be my new favorite film of 2013. Unfortunately it didn't, but it's still in my top5.When it turns into a one-woman show by Bullock, after Clooney drifts into space (the only scene that had my eyes kinda wet), it gets a bit worse, but still not really bad. Bullock is basically making her way through ships, shuttles and space stations and at some point it just got less interesting when she fell again and some mechanism failed again and the alarm went off again etc. and at some point I just stopped being interested in what was wrong now. It also certainly didn't help that she's not my favorite actress really and this film could not make me see the light on her. There were scenes like the howling, which could have been so great if performed differently, it just didn't engage me at all. Same goes for the scene in whhhich she discovers that there's no more fuel and keeps going \"You gotta be kidding me.\" There I almost cringed. Clooney's short reappearance later on wasn't on par with his early scenes either, although it was still better than most from the second half of the film as those scenes that included references to Bullock's life, or lack thereof, were still emotionally superior to her pure fight for survival. The writing was another strength of the film. When it was good, it was really good and the message behind the film could certainly motivate someone to get out of a hole they've been in for way too long.Finally, about the ending, let me say that I may have preferred a different, unhappy outcome. Sure it may have been a bummer to some, but the final scene on the beach did not hit me as hard emotionally or made me as ecstatic as I'd have hoped for and it could still convey the aforementioned message strongly if she had only almost made it. Actually it would have been an interesting symbolism if she had managed to survive in space, but not survive on Earth when the water entered her cabin for example. Or maybe go for a bit of an open ending with credits rolling in right before the crucial moment when we see if she will live or die. Anyway, even with these criticisms, it's a well-written, visually enthralling film with a good story line. I'm really surprised so many actresses passed before Bullock got the part. I personally believe I might have enjoyed it more with somebody else in the lead, but it was still a good effort by her. Gravity comes close to a must-watch.

{"review": "I am really not a fan of 3D; I dislike that everything seems darker and a little bit harder to see and even for the big banner 3D movie (Avatar) it seemed like an unnecessary gimmick that didn't do enough to cover up a not particularly good film. Add to this the number of films that are cheaply retrofitted with 3D for the sake of money and I really have no interest in seeing anything in 3D if I have a normal option. Gravity was the exception since from what I heard it was probably worth seeing in 3D and from seeing it I can agree with this.As a piece of technology, Gravity is really impressive. I always think that the absolute best use of special effects in films are those where you forget how impressive they are because they really don't stand out as different from everything else but are just part of the construct. That is the case here as space just feels real and the huge amount of work to make it happen isn't made a fuss of and doesn't get in the way of enjoying the film. Helping you forget this is the fact that the film is a real experience in terms of the story as a ride. Within a few minutes you are in the middle of the experience and it really doesn't stop until the end. Visually I did still feel the 3D made the images darker than they should have been and reduced the clarity of my whole field of vision, but in this case the feeling of being \"in\" the film really work and aside from one or two \"thing coming at you\" moments, it really worked. For me equally impressive was the sound engineering; most sound effects are given a really satisfying \"via contact\" sound \u2013 the sound where the vibrations come via water or another material like they vibrate through your body rather than in the air. This was done so very well and helped me get into it as much as the visuals and effects.The one thing to say though is that all of this probably only applies if you see it in the cinema and with the full experience because this is what it is about \u2013 and it would be wrong to get sucked up in the experience and not see the weaknesses within this film. Specifically these are in the content and they will be more apparent on a smaller screen. The events within the film are so unlikely that without these strong aspects drawing you in, they will probably be more likely to push you out of the experience to question what you are watching. Attempts to add character and back story are OK but only as part of an already engaging experience \u2013 mostly they are only so-so and one or two rather clunky bits of symbolism really don't work. That said it is not down to the cast. Clooney may be very much about his calmness under pressure and his great presence but Bullock does a very good job to be vulnerable and fighting to survive and just like the effects do, her performance draws you in even if the material she sometimes has to deliver has the potential to do the opposite.Gravity is only 90 minutes and it moves with intensity and urgency that is effective and greatly helped by how great it is as an experience. As such it will work best by far with a large screen and those silly overpriced glasses on because it is all about this and in this context the weaknesses are less impacting \u2013 but there are weaknesses and they do have an impact and I suspect that as the film moves onto smaller screens, these will be more apparent.", "helpfulness": 0.5666666666666667}

And there is no arguing that this looks amazing, with or without the IMAX and 3D. Some have called it this year's \"Life of Pi\" or \"Avatar\" and there is plenty of truth to that.Others have been critical of its scientific accuracy, which seems odd. Sure, Bullock is not wearing \"space diapers\" and not everything might have behaved how it would in zero gravity situations. But this is hardly the point. The chances of anyone surviving in this scenario are basically nil, so just accept that it is fiction and give them a little bit of wiggle room to tell the story.As for the story itself, I was not terribly impressed. The themes of isolation, desperation, hopelessness and hope are all good ones, and I have to give them credit for providing a fair range for Bullock's character. Others have pointed out the spiritual symbolism, which I concede was lost on me and may be one reason I think it was not the masterpiece others have said.The praise is near-universal, with critic A. O. Scott saying that the film \"in a little more than 90 minutes rewrites the rules of cinema as we have known them.\" How do you top that? James Cameron stated, \"I think it's the best space photography ever done, I think it's the best space film ever done, and it's the movie I've been hungry to see for an awful long time.\" Which, coming from the leader of cutting-edge film technology, is the highest of compliments.With regard to the Academy Awards, the film earned ten nominations (tying it with \"American Hustle\"), many of which are in the technical categories, and it sincerely deserves to win those awards. Director Alfonso Cuaron, known for his Harry Potter film and \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" among others, really went out on a limb here and should be recognized for that. He won the Golden Globe, and I think he deserves the Oscar, too. To helm such a project takes intestinal fortitude few (besides perhaps Cameron) could muster.Bullock as best actress is debatable. Although much was done by computer animation, and thus amounts to more or less voicing a cartoon, the parts she physically appeared in deserve respect and admiration. Bullock stayed in a special mechanical rig for up to ten hours a day, communicating with others only through a headset. That is dedication that was not matched by Amy Adams or Meryl Streep.Best score I could accept, though I do not feel strongly about it one way or the other. Steven Price, at age 36, is a relative newcomer, and it would be nice to see him enter the world of Hans Zimmer and John Williams. But is this his time? Lastly, best picture. And I say no. Much like Ang Lee received best director for \"Life of Pi\" but failed to get best picture, I think the same could be said here.

Basically, from the Space Shuttle \"Explorer\", a small crew of astronauts are making repairs to the Hubble Space Telescope, commanding the mission is veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) on his final expedition, and on her first journey into space is Mission Specialist and bio-medical engineer Ryan Stone (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Sandra Bullock). Everything is calm as the astronauts work, but then the voice of Mission Control (Ed Harris) warns them a missile strike by the Russians has occurred on a defunct satellite near their location, a chain reaction has caused debris to scatter and is speeding towards them, they must abort the mission before it reaches them. Communication with Mission Control is lost, but the astronauts continue to transmit hoping to be heard, the debris strikes and causes destruction, in panic Stone is forced to detach herself from the shuttle, leaving her drifting alone in space, with only her suit keeping her alive, and she is scared as her oxygen level is low. Eventually Kowalski responds to her call for help, locates her, and they make their way back to the damaged shuttle, it is unusable and the rest of the crew are dead, the only option is to use the thruster pack to travel to the nearby International Space Station (ISS), at least a ninety minute journey before debris threatens them again. En route Kowalski asks about Stone's life back on Earth, she tells the sad story about the death of her young daughter, they reach the damaged but still operational space station, the crew evacuated and the parachute from the other capsule has accidentally deployed, it cannot be used to return to Earth, Kowalski suggests they use remaining equipment to travel to the nearby Chinese space station \"Tiangong\" and use a module to return home. Another problem occurs when Stone's leg gets tangled in the parachute cords, the thruster pack has no power so if she keeps hold of Kowalski they drift into space together, so even with her protesting he detaches himself, as he goes into the distance he stays on the radio to give her instructions and further encouragement, as she runs low on oxygen and tries to make it into the ISS airlock. Inside Stone settles and gets things ready to journey to the next space station, but a fire ignites and forces her to enter the Soyuz and escape, before the capsule can travel she goes back out to release the parachute cords, debris hits again, she is in time before it destroys the station, and she aligns her craft to reach the Chinese station not too far away. However the craft thrusters are out of action, using the radio she only manages to communicate with a fisherman with a baby, Stone is sure that she will die, so turns off the oxygen supply to die a painless death in space, becoming unconscious Kowalski appears outside and enters the capsule, he is annoyed she is giving up and suggests using the landing rockets to travel. She wakes up realising the appearance of Kowalski was a hallucination, but she is determined to live on, she restores the oxygen supply and navigates to the Tiangong with the landing rockets, she is unable to dock, so she uses the decompression force and a fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster pack to travel to the Chinese space station, once boarded she finds it empty, but also its trajectory knocked by the debris, and it is falling out of orbit. So she enters the escape capsule, as the ship is breaking up with it re-entering the Earth's atmosphere, Mission Control communicates with her and has can locate her position, and following the heat of the atmosphere the parachute is deployed, the craft lands in a lake, but an electrical fire starting means she has to evacuate immediately, opening the hatch water sinks the capsule, she sheds her suit and swims to the surface, she rests for a moment on the shore, and takes her first shaky steps in the full gravity of Earth. Also starring Orto Ignatiussen as Aningaaq, Amy Warren as Explorer Captain and EastEnders' Phaldut Sharma as Shariff. Bullock gives a graceful, amiable and suitably desperate performance as the talented scientist on her first mission into space, and Clooney is charming, jokey and decisive in his scenes, the direction by Cuar\u00f3n is swish and polished with this mix of Speed style tension action and 2001: A Space Odyssey with the scale and spectacular effects and sounds of space. With the cool and stylish use of three-dimensional effects, the feeling of claustrophobia inside spacesuits and small capsules, and the combinations of fantasy, humanity and the fight for survival, there is no doubt that this will enthrall and immerse you into the action, it truly is one of the best 3D and space films in years that deserves accolades, a great science-fiction thriller. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Music, Original Score for Steven Price, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and Best Production Design, it won the BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, and the Anthony Asquith Award for Best Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Sound, and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Original Screenplay, Best Editing, and Best Production Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and Best Original Score.

{"review": "A team of four astronauts is out in space repairing some floating piece of American technology. The team is led by George Clooney and Sandra Bullock. Oops -- force majeur. An accident elsewhere in the sky sends an invidious junk yard of space debris hurtling in their direction. They can't escape it, and two of the team are killed as their entry vehicle is destroyed.This leaves Bullock and Clooney spinning around without any way of returning to earth without getting burned up by the atmosphere. Clooney's solution: He tethers Bullock's space suit to the mobile chair he occupies and they head towards a nearby, abandoned Soyuz that has a workable re-entry system, as well as oxygen.Bullock makes it. Clooney sacrifices himself, making cheerful wisecracks as he glides off in the general direction of Betelgeuse. Bullock is some kind of engineer and lacks confidence but she becomes resourceful. In the empty but pressurized Soyuz she has the good sense to strip off that hampering space suit so we can see her floating around in a tank top and a pair of tight black shorts.Alas, the space debris comes whipping around in its orbit and bangs into the Soyuz and it tumbles around and Bullock dons a drab Russian space suit and launches a pod towards an old, decaying Chinese space station, and everything is whipped around as Newton's laws prevail, things are spun and bumped around like pin balls, there are loud thumps and WHOOMS, and I don't know what all.We've seen danger in modern space stories before. \"Marooned\" and the like. They're all kind of interesting if they're at all well done. They raise provocative questions like \"What the hell are we DOING out here where there is no IHOP?\" This movie gets underneath all that tension but it does so too extravagantly. The viewer is overwhelmed by the (very good) computer-generated images. And, if nothing else, the musical score will pound you into insensibility. It's full of weird sounds, eerie noises barely heard, ominous electronic chords, drums beating faster than a sprinter's heart. And it's loud.Stripped to its armature, what we have is one of those journey movies in which the lost person or persons must find their way from one watering hole to the next, hoping to hit the town or the railroad, as they plod through the desert and get bitten by rattlesnakes and stuck by vicious cholla. John Ford's \"Three Godfathers\" is a good example.It's entertaining enough and sometimes thrilling. Clooney is such a likable guy, no matter his film character. And Sandra Bullock looks choice in a short haircut and short shorts. Can she really be fifty this year? She doesn't bring that much to the role. How could she? There is one touching moment when she is preparing to die and listens to an Eskimo singing a faint lullaby on the radio, but calls mostly for gasps and brief, breathless monologues. However, she speaks German flawlessly and I give her a bonus point for that. I give the movie a bonus point, too, for not being nearly as dumbed-down as most recent Hollywood productions, although this will challenge no one's sensibilities.", "helpfulness": 0.5}
{"review": "After the testing of an anti-satellite missile goes disastrously wrong; the debris quickly hits other satellites causing a snowball effect as more and more debris is created. This debris is heading at very high speed towards the crew of a US shuttle who are on a mission to repair the Hubble Telescope. When it strikes there are only two survivors; Ryan Stone, a female biomedical engineer on her first mission; and Matt Kowalski, a seasoned astronaut with many missions under his belt. With the shuttle effectively destroyed they must find another way home and understandably the choices are limited. There is a Soyuz module at the nearby International Space Station but that has been damaged in a way that makes re-entry impossible; it may be able to travel to the Chinese space station where there is a similar module but that is a hundred kilometres away.If you are looking for a film with a deep plot and lots of twists then this is not it; once the disaster strikes the only route home is quickly established. That doesn't mean the film is boring though; the action is spectacular as the two survivors struggle at each stage. There are some surprises too but I'll try not to spoil the main one! The cast does a fine job; Sandra Bullock carries the film as Ryan Stone nicely portraying her fear and determination, she is ably supported by George Clooney who plays Kowalski; a smaller part but equally important to the story. The special effects are amazing bringing the viewer right into the action even when watched on a small screen\u0085 although this is the first film I've watched on a television for some time that I thought I would have liked to have seen it in the cinema.

Yeah, I can't claim to be a fan of neither Bullock nor Clooney.However, with all the great reviews and publicity the movie was getting, I decided to give it a go, and I must admit that I am possibly surprised by it.George Clooney and Sandra Bullock are so far away from their usual roles here that it actually works out quite well, and especially Bullock was carrying the movie so amazingly well with her performance here.The story was greatly paced and there was never really a dull moment throughout the movie. And those quiet moments here and there throughout the course of the movie just helped to add to the believability of the movie and it was like the audience was right there in space with them.I will say that a lot of credit for this movie really goes out to the camera crew. Wow, the cinematography and the angles here were just great, it was very dynamic, vibrant and so full of adrenaline. The way that the movie was shot was so helpful to adding to the atmosphere and the believability of the movie.Now, don't expect to see any aliens or foreign lifeforms. No, this is solely a movie about having all odds against you and rising to the occasion and relying on your instincts and putting your training to use.

As with most highly hyped movies, when viewer expectations are heightened, the actual viewing doesn't quite match the high expectations. We saw it on DVD, a Redbox rental. However it is a very good and entertaining movie with a good share of drama. Will they or will they not survive the surprise rain of new space debris?Sandra Bullock is a PhD scientist Ryan Stone, sent on a repair mission for the Hubble telescope. This is realistic, as that equipment has had similar repair missions. While she has trained for months for the mission, she is not a pilot and will encounter particular difficulties in this unplanned event.Her main partner is very experienced astronaut and pilot, George Clooney as Matt Kowalski, a carefree type of guy who always seems to have a \"story\" for mission control.All hell breaks loose during their EVA (extra-vehicular activity) when a Russian planned destruction of obsolete orbiting equipment starts a type of chain reaction and a great debris field orbiting at normal orbit speed, in a trajectory that crosses that of the US astronauts every 90 minutes. Their hope of competing the mission, or even preserving the space station, are gone and the movie is simply about their trying to survive and get back to Earth, back to gravity! Pretty fascinating effects to simulate weightlessness and working in space, the movie is well-made and entertaining.SPOILERS: Kowalski hooks up Stone to himself via a tether and he uses the power of his jet pack to maneuver them towards another space station. However running out of fuel and oxygen, Kowalski unhooks himself and leaves Stone to try to survive as he drifts away, doomed. In a complicated series of events she manages to get into an escape pod and makes it safely to Earth, almost drowning as she lands in a lake, but the movie ends as she pulls herself up and turns to walk away.", "helpfulness": 0.6666666666666666}

But it must have been mind-boggling because without the 3D, it was pretty stunning.Not much here in the way of story -- Sandra Bullock plays a woman literally lost in space and trying to find her way back to earth, via a shuttle that's rather far off.The neat thing for me about this film is that the director took his time with the moments rather than rushing through and trying to have an action sequence every two seconds. We watch Bullock, alone, as she goes through various thought processes and attempts to figure out what to do. One rarely sees that type of thing anymore.Bullock is excellent, and it's a great role for her - adventurous, athletic, and emotional with a few light moments. George Clooney's role is small, but he's likable.For me, though, the star of this film was the beauty and the silence - something that we're not used to today.

Yes, it's about two people in space who get into snafus while there but the images are beautiful, the acting by George Clooney and Sandra Bullock are good, Alfonso Cuaron's direction is aces, and the story is suspenseful enough. Ms. Bullock is especially compelling enough for the time on screen when she's by herself not knowing if anyone can hear her when she's on headphones. Her character's monologue never gets boring as she's always addressing what she's going through and how she's coping with what she's dealing with at the moment.

{"review": "The story begins in 2027. The human race is completely screwed, as fertility has completely disappeared and the last child was born over 18 years ago. Why this is the case, no one seems to know. There also was a worldwide flu pandemic in 2008 that apparently killed millions. As a result of all this, people react as they often do...with panic, confusion and self-destruction. The planet is now a mess...with widespread terrorism, reactionary governments and fear. Nuclear detonations, terror bombings and depression are the norm. As for the UK where the film is set, it's better off than most of the world...and so there's been a huge influx of illegal aliens AND the government has responded with draconian measures.The main character in this story is Theo (Clive Owen), a bureaucrat whose wife, Julian (Julianne Moore) left him long ago following the death of their son in the pandemic. She has taken up with a domestic terrorist organization and he hasn't seen her for many years. Out of the blue, she approaches him asking for his help sneaking someone out of the country. Who this is and why...you can learn this when you see the film. Just understand...what happens are some things you just won't expect!Before I talk about whether or not I liked the movie, it's VERY important to talk about how depressing the story is. Considering the recent COVID outbreak, the panic and chaos in the story seem even more terrifying. If you are depressed or scared about COVID, this is probably a film you best see another time or not at all. Again, I am NOT saying it's a bad film...it's just one that might be tough now for some viewers. With all the death, suicide and the like, this is NOT an upbeat film despite there being some hope as the film progresses.The story is depressing and interesting at the same time. The standout in this film, however, is the cinematography and the long composite shots. And, even if the story is off-putting to many, you can't deny it took a lot of skill to make the movie. Worth seeing and a one-of-a-kind story from start to finish, it's hard to rate this one as the film clearly is not for everyone.

{"review": "I will be very honest, I wouldn't have said that about Children of Men four years ago. When I saw it for the very first time, I didn't like it very much, while I loved the cinematography, direction and soundtrack I found it rather dull and confusing. On rewatch some time ago, I was dumbfounded at how wrong I was initially, and since again it has very quickly become a favourite of mine.I do agree that there is the occasional surfeit of plot exposition and that it is slow. However, the story with its wonderful concept left me transfixed throughout. As for it being slow, I got the impression it was meant to be slow to add to its haunting atmosphere. Also Children of Men is one of those movies I think that you need to see more than once to truly appreciate it.The soundtrack is very well chosen and beautifully incorporated into the story. The two John Tavener songs were very beautiful and haunting, and brilliantly performed. Jarvis Cocker's Running the World was okay, while the Shostakovich was a real treat. Same with Ruby Tuesday. My favourite was Mahler's amazing Kindertotenleider, sublimely sung by the king of Leider(for me anyway) Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.The acting is very good. Clive Owen is really quite excellent in the lead, with a brooding and charismatic presence this is the best I have seen him act. Julianne Moore is lovely and very believable. Michael Caine is the real star of the cast though, his turn here is simply glorious.The best assets of Children of Men are the visuals and direction. Children of Men is a triumph when it comes to visuals. The decision for the use of hand-held camera was a risk but it worked so well with the dark and affecting atmosphere. The scenery is also miraculous and the colours are wonderful. But for me, this is Alfonso Cuaron's movie, a very underrated film-maker Cuaron's direction is absolutely superb.Overall, maybe not completely flawless but amazing. I also disagree with the naysayers that it is overrated, in my opinion it is the other way around. This film is very well made, has a great soundtrack, an interesting concept and story, exhilarating action sequences, fine acting and I seriously think Cuaron should have more credit for his direction here.

{"review": "This futuristic thriller disposes of much of the sci-fi jargon we've come to expect from Hollywood films. There are no outlandish gadgets or chases through CGI-created landscapes; CHILDREN OF MEN, based on a novel by P. D. James, is a realistic thriller through and through. It's set in a recognisable dystopia (full of violence, poverty, disease, segregation and warfare) and the story follows a strict 'journey' template, following a group of characters as they travel through myriad locales, suffering death, defeat and adventure along the way. So far, so predictable. However, this film works because it's literate, it's intelligent and the focus is on storytelling over flashy special effects or action nonsense.Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron (HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN) is a force to watch out for on the strength of his work here: this is the best direction I've seen in a long while and the film is chock-full of great tracking shots which really emphasise the excitement and danger around every corner. The view of a future UK is nightmarish and believable and the backgrounds and locations are as much a character as the protagonists themselves.I also enjoyed the fact that the film remains as unconventional as possible as it moves along. Clive Owen, the heroic protagonist, never fires a gun and is definitely an everyman character rather than a hero: he's utterly believable and this is the best role I've seen the actor in yet. Supporting actors are good, but it's the older heavyweights who give the best turns: Julianne Moore, as likable as she's ever been, as a terrorist leader; Pam Ferris as an ally; Michael Caine as an aged John Lennon-type. Chiwetel Ejiofor is also very strong in a minor role. The film does have action, including a ferocious fire fight at the climax, but it's never an action film per se.

When he is murdered in a brutal attack it stuns the world, only further sapping the hope in a world where the aging population has given up, economies have collapsed, terrorism is rife and Governments are focused on control rather than improving anything for anyone. In the middle of this former activist Theo is approached to help transport a woman across checkpoints to the coast where the mysterious \"human project\" is working to save mankind.Interesting to look back on some groups of films and see what they tell us about the times they were made in. The sci-fi's of the 1950's point to an external threat that is different from us and must be feared an conquered for example. It will be interesting to look back on Children of Men and other recent sci-fis such as V for Vendetta because already they seem so attuned with the world we now live in. Children of Men jumps just into the future to a world crumbling with no real hope for anyone other than those clinging to what little privilege power offers them. This is the strength of the film as it builds a futuristic world that is so palatable \u0096 remote from our own but yet so easy to believe. There are problems with the narrative in regards pitching it to a mass audience though. Many (including myself at times) will struggle with not understanding and knowing everything about this world.This did bother me at times but mostly the central story was exciting and interesting enough to engage \u0096 so what if the story doesn't fill in the whole history of where we are now, or if the film finishes where it does rather than giving us a firm conclusion? That is not the nature of the story and it is part of the telling. For something so downbeat and with these open aspects, the film does a great job of gripping. The background detail of this future makes for a strong foundation for Theo and Kee to move through, producing some interesting plot points but also a surprising amount of action. The ambush on Julian's car is exciting but it doesn't compare to the final scenes where Theo attempts to rescue Kee; not only is that scene gripping but it is technically very impressive as it is delivered in long, complex takes where you feel you get no respite. The script is not perfect though and some of it is clunky and not as intelligent as it thinks it is (lest we forget that this is script that calls the character holding the future of mankind \"Kee\") but mostly it is very strong.Owen holds the film together with a central character that is hardly off the screen but yet we never tire of him. There are a lot of stars alongside him but he owns the film by far. Moore has a small turn that is effective albeit more because of her surprise fate rather than her amazing turn. Caine is amusing but is wisely kept to the sidelines while Ejiofor, Mullan, Huston and others all fill in the smaller characters. Ashitey is OK but not as strong as I would have liked; she didn't convince me in her skin and it was too easy to see her character as a plot device rather than a character. As director, Cuar\u00f3n delivers the goods with an impressive group effort that makes this future so convincing and gritty. The sets are well done and London etc locations are subverted just in the right way to keep them real as well as different. Lubezki's cinematography is impressive throughout and personally, having seen both now, I think he should have had the Oscar that instead went to Pan's Labyrinth.Overall an intelligent and interest sci-fi that says a lot about the times we live now in how it views the future.

That's when loner Theo Faron (Clive Owen) gets kidnapped by anti-government group The Fishes, who just might have the key to the future.One of the movie's best aspects is the cinematography. There's a lot of hand-held long shots, creating a feeling of being there with the grim action. The dreary setting adds to this. As in \"VFV\", it becomes apparent that the revolutionaries might not be much different from the government which they oppose. But what's one to do in such a society?

This film is so full of social commentary, but it's done in an artistic and powerful way. Maybe not a subtle way, as they prominently feature Homeland Security, immigration crackdowns and even a man with a hood over his head forced to stand with electrodes on his hands (a now iconic image of Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq). How does the government handle crises and crack down on dissidence? Maybe not to this extreme in real life, but then again some would say this is where we're headed.Clive Owen is amazing as the everyman (albeit more a hero than most would be). Michael Caine is also good, though I think he tried too hard to be John Lennon. The character of Kee is most fascinating, and people have pointed out how her name sounds like \"key\" (the key to the future of humanity) and \"chi\" (an Asian word meaning, basically, \"life force\"). I have to assume this was intentional, just as Theo's name must be (meaning \"god\"). What's surprising to me is how well they kept the religious aspects minimized. While they are important to the plot, they're always in the background. Compare this to \"The Mist\" where religious fanaticism takes center stage and become obnoxious (and it's not long before an obnoxious character makes a film itself obnoxious).Dystopian films tend to be well-made, and this is no exception. The director took great pains to get long shots filmed (some going over six minutes straight) and the use of the hand-held really added to the feeling of being embedded in a world of war and violence. Do not pass up on this one. If you only have time to see it once, make sure you see it once. But you may end up wanting to own it for repeated viewings.", "helpfulness": 0.5}
{"review": "2027: Society has collapsed into total violent anarchy and no children have been born in the last eighteen years. Glumly indifferent Theodore Faron (a superb Clive Owen) gets shocked out of his morose apathy when his underground revolutionary ex-wife Julian Taylor (the always fine Julianne Moore) enlists his aid to get the miraculously pregnant Kee (beautifully played by radiant newcomer Claire-Hope Ashitey) out of the country before the authoritarian government finds out about her. Director/co-writer Alfonso Cuaron brilliantly creates a plausibly bleak and depressing future where chaos is the dismal norm and mankind has lost its ability for hope. Cuaron wisely downplays needless flashy special effects in favor of emphasizing both the intriguing plot and equally interesting complex characters; he brings a sense of true heartfelt emotion and heartbreaking tragedy to the picture that's both poignant and powerful. The sparingly used special effects are seamless and convincing. The action sequences are fast, brutal, thrilling and harrowing as all hell. The uniformly terrific acting from a top-rate cast rates as another substantial asset: Owen delivers a very strong and touching portrayal of a man who regains his capacity to care and feel, Moore shines in her regrettably brief role, Ashitey brings a terrifically brassy'n'sassy strength and humor to her part, and Michael Caine is simply wonderful as Jasper, a blithely irreverent dippy hippie pothead who helps Theodore out when he's on the lam from the police. But what truly makes this movie so special, resonant and remarkable is its thoughtful and affecting central message about the immeasurable value of human life.

{"review": "During its release I think I may have seen one or two short clips and I definitely saw the poster, and I thought it was certainly something I wanted to try in the near future, I'm really glad I eventually did, from director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban). Basically in London, England, 2027, no children have been born anywhere in the world for eighteen years since all women have become infertile, and the youngest person in the world, Baby Diego (Juan Gabriel Yacuzzi) from Argentina, has been killed, leaving everyone devastated. The other big issues are the government almost collapsing, Britain becoming a militarised police state, and the big issue is the increase in illegal immigrants, it has become against the law for pretty much everyone foreign to be living in the country. Living in amongst all the devastation is former activist turned apathetic bureaucrat Theodore Faron (Clive Owen), who often visits his friend, ageing hippie, former cartoonist and marijuana grower/smoker Jasper (Sir Michael Caine). One day Theo gets kidnapped by the underground gang called The Fishes, who are against everything wrong in the world at the moment, he is surprised to learn that his wife Julian (Julianne Moore), who left after the death of their son in 2008 from flu, is their leader. She is offering him money to get a travel permit for young refugee Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), which he manages to obtain from his government minister cousin Nigel (Danny Huston), but he has to escort her for more money. While travelling towards the boat to get on, Julian is fatally shot by an ambush group of armed people, making fellow Fishes member Luke (Love Actually's Chiwetel Ejiofor) the new leader. After getting away, Kee reveals the true reason why she needs to get away from everything, she is pregnant, and Julian intended to hand her over to the protection of The Human Project. Theo suggest that they should think about going public about the pregnancy, but the Fishes argue that the government would only take and use the baby when it is born. At night he overhears Luke and an accomplice or two saying that it was actually some of the Fishes themselves that orchestrated the death of Julian to gain revolution support, so he takes Kee and midwife Miriam (Matilda's Pam Ferris) to escape and go to Jasper. After the Fishes find out his hideout and kill him, Theo, Kee and Miriam manage to get away and meet up with Jasper's friend, camp guard Syd (Peter Mullan), who transports them as fake prisoners to Bexhill. It is there tat Kee starts having her contractions and needs somewhere to give birth, so they find an abandoned room provided by Marichka (Oana Pellea), the baby born is a girl. The next day Kee and Theo are caught in the middle of a full scale uprising of refugees, The Fishes have broken into Bexhill, and the army have mobilised, there is a point when they are taken apart, but they get back together and hide. They are slowly allowed out of the building when everyone is shocked to see a newborn baby, but the attacks start again and Maricka leads them to the sewer boat and they row out to the point where the ship Tomorrow will pick them up, but Theo dies and Kee is alone with the baby. The film is full of very poignant subjects, the cast is very impressive, the shaky camera movement, including one or two long takes not cutting away (even with spots of blood on the camera), is very effective, all in all, it is a brilliant futuristic thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, and it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects.

{"review": "There's a remarkable long Steadicam shot in which the camera follows the hero, Clive Owen, through a raging battle -- buildings being blown up, bullets pinging around him -- and into a doorway and up a flight of stairs and through room after room until he finds what he's searching for -- the first woman to become pregnant in eighteen years. Owen, and some supporters who come and go, are trying to get this pregnant African stranger to an offshore haven where, biology permitting, the human race will begin to reproduce itself again. I was unable to figure out how one baby will save the species.Neither is the reason for the pandemic infertility ever explained but it doesn't really matter much. It's basically a chase movie. Owen and his charge don't have many friends. It's a Hobbesian war of all against all. London is a wreck. The ruins are filled with refugees from other countries, each eagerly killing one another, shouting slogans, waving their AK-47s over their heads. The air is filled with gun fire. A pox on all their houses; a midline granuloma!As a chase movie it's pretty good, carrying a powerful emotional message. The gravid woman, who is quite ordinary, is a Life Force, kind of like Zorba the Greek. I guess that's intended to be good, and it is if you ignore certain inconvenient facts. (The tubercle bacillus has a Life Force too.) It's also easy to read a religious lesson in it. None of that's necessary though. It's tense and tautly constructed, even if it doesn't make much sense. The refugees have no one they can trust and few are anxious to help them. The best seem to lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity.I am, though, getting tired of this photographic conceit in which the sun never shines, everyone is grimy and greasy, it's either drizzling or looks about to, every object has an unhappy greenish tinge, and all the men need a shave. Enough already. I also have to wag my finger because there are plenty of dogs in the movie but no cats. My cat, Ajax the Lesser, pointed this out to me. Outside of a dog, a cat is a man's best friend. Inside a dog, it's too dark to see.There is also a kind of paradox built into the movie. The only hope for mankind is a return to fertility. Yet what we see of mankind doesn't reflect well upon it. With all social niceties being eliminated, there seems to be nothing left of government but a horde of uniformed murderous fascists. Judge Learned Hand said, \"A society in which men recognize no check on their freedom soon becomes a society where freedom is the possession of only a savage few.\" In this world, everyone appears intent on killing everyone else in order to be among the savage few. The writers should have challenged some of their own assumptions. Look at what Homo sapiens has accomplished -- in 2027 and now. Do we really want to start it all over again?

Meantime , a rebel outfit of militia (Chiwetel Ejiofor , Charlie Hunnam) refugees known as The Fish loom threateningly in the background , battling for the rights of the illegals and determined to cause major unrest . There no children , no future , no hope. Exciting rendition that picks up every mote of bleak despair P.D. James's novel of a totalitarian future society in which a man whose daily work is rewriting history tries to help a pregnant young ; though in the movie, the infertility crisis is the result of all women being infertile and in the original novel , it's the result of all men producing no sperm . This interesting retelling describes an eerie future in frenetic Cinema V\u00e9rite' style , pointed ideological concerns and gripping familiarity . A hard , explosive , paranoid time when England is the only surviving nation and fertility crisis means no babies have been born for 18 years old , being well set in and around a dystopian London fractious with violence and warring nationalistic sects . Dystopian polemic story which contain a sour denounce to totalitarianism , gilded with some cheeky as well as unobtrusive social commentary . Thought-provoking and thoughtful script by Paul Chart who wrote the first version but it was re-written a few times by other screenwriters including Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Timothy J. Sexton and director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n himself ; finally the final version was written by David Arata, Cuar\u00f3n and Sexton . Clive Owen's insights greatly impressed Cuar\u00f3n and he contributed a great deal of uncredited work to the final script . \"Children of men\" is a workmanlike rendition of notorious novel that captures the desolation and misery found within those pages , though some liberties have been taken with the script . Nice acting by Clive Owen as a man man who holds the unexpected discovery of a lone pregnant woman and the desperate journey to deliver her to safety . Very good support cast such as Michael Caine , Pam Ferris , Chiwetel Ejiofor , Charlie Hunnam , Danny Huston , Julianne Moore and cameo by P.D. James: author of the book 'The Children of Men' plays the old woman in the cafeteria with Theo .Colorful and evocative cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki , Alfonso Cuaron's ordinary .

The motion picture was well directed by ever versatile Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambi\u00e9n , Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban , Gravity) who carries out an efficient and energetic take on . Cuaron said in one interview that he wanted to shoot this film like La Battle of Argiels (1966) rather than Blade Runner (1982), almost like a documentary about something that happened back in 2027 .

{"review": "\"Children of Men\" didn't exactly set the box-office afire, and one look at it tells you why: the bleak film packs a wallop, but not the kind of rousing cinematic punch we get with most war movies. This one, set in 2027 London, hits too close to home for mass audience acceptance; it offers no hope for anybody, especially viewers in the need for a quick entertainment fix. Clive Owen plays a British working-stiff annoyed by (and, perhaps, immune to) the constant world-violence saturating the media; after nearly getting killed in an explosion, he agrees to help his ex-wife (and terrorist operative) with a mission to smuggle a young woman across the border. The hitch is, the lady is eight months pregnant--the first such occurrence in eighteen years! A horrifying vision of war, one with no good or bad sides, just senseless brutality and inhumanity. Though compact at one hour and forty-two minutes, \"Children of Men\" is a staggering achievement yet is a difficult one to get through. One almost recoils from it--but only because its lawlessness isn't very hard to fathom, which is both helplessly disturbing and cruelly enlightening. **1/2 from ****", "helpfulness": 0.5294117647058824}
{"review": "Alfonso Cuaron, make no mistake, knows what he's doing with the style of Children of Men. Following from the same cues he started off with Y Tu Mama Tambein, his and Emmanual Lebiznaki's camera never stops to go onto a dolly or just to stand still, it's always hand-held and on edge with the characters and the dire situations they're set in 2029 Britain. Sometimes this allows for some really incredible long-takes implemented (my favorite a very pivotal death/chase scene that occurs surprisingly early in the film), allowing Cuaron with complete subjective freedom of perspective. There's never a moment to relax in this world, as just setting a cup of coffee in the middle of the city square could have the next second arriving a bomb just next door. However, perhaps if only for me, the style called attention to itself sometimes, or to the fact that it's all 'just a movie'. Not that there isn't some very gritty action and horrific bloody violence that comes out, notably in the climactic \"uprising\" as Clive Owen's Theo almost escapes being annihilated among the total chaos in an especially long take (blood spats on the lens included).The whole set-up of the story of Children of Men is simple, and I (unfortunately maybe) knew most of it from the trailer. Owen works a dead-end job in the only country where there is some \"stability\" (note the quotes) at a time in the world where infertility is dead and the youngest man alive has just died. There's terrorists everywhere, no one can really rest easy, and the police state makes it very hard to get around on the roads, not to mention the immigration problem (sound familiar?). Enter in Julianne Moore's character, who was once lovers with Theo, and needs his help to get a foreigner across to safer grounds. But it becomes further complicated when the cat's out of the bag- she's pregnant, and needs to get to safety to have her child. So then the characters are off on the mission, however complicated further by the (well laid) twist that the group that were originally going to help get the woman to the \"Human Project\"- where she could be looked after with the best spark of hope- really just want the baby as collateral to propagate their uprising against the government. Meanwhile, the chaos continues and continues.In a sense, this is probably the bleakest futuristic \"pro-life\" movie ever made, however pro-life in relation to Children of Men is actually a necessity rather than a political or religious point. There seems to be no respite from civilization eating itself up at the thought that humanity will end if procreation becomes nothingness, and so part of the strength in Children of Men is seeing the conviction behind the main message in the film. In a time where there is practically a culture of death by way of a lack of governmental control and a burst of extremism, the only hope is new life, if only in a small dose. Populating around this message- which only becomes a little thicker by the end of the film- is a strong performance from Owen, who maybe doesn't have as much range as usual due to him being mostly a reactionary (mostly with shock and conflict, and early on malaise) at what's around him. Michael Caine also turns in the amusingly human supporting turn as a pot-smoking ex-political cartoonist. Even the woman who plays the most crucial one in the picture- who may or may not name her child Bazooka- is very good in the part.So why didn't I respond to it with overwhelming enthusiasm and with a place for it in my top 10 of the year? Hard to say even hours after seeing it. Maybe there is almost a certain lack of momentum even as the clock ticks down on the pregnancy. The bleakness that carried over the picture is so thick and disparaging it's half a relief from seeing other futuristic pictures that don't deliver so much on the dread and decay of humanity gone to the dogs, and half a desire for it to not be as such. No doubt I recommend it to all who'd like a serious trip into an original Orwellian-nightmare-popcorn-thriller (if that makes sense), though I don't think it's necessarily a full-blown masterpiece...AMENDMENT TO PREVIOUS REVIEW (month & a half later): I rewatched the film, and I liked it even more; it gets deeper, with its message more impactful and the staggering long-takes even more powerful- and it is one of the best directed films of the decade.", "helpfulness": 0.36363636363636365}

{"review": "Various highly acclaimed and respected sources of criticism refer to \"Children of Men\" as the absolute greatest Sci-Fi movie since \"Blade Runner\". I can't really disagree with that, since I never was a big supporter of this particular classic, but still \"Children of Men\" isn't the unhinged new masterpiece everyone claims it to be. The grim atmosphere is great, the sets are greatly depressing, some details in the script are truly extraordinary, the abrupt plot twists are shocking and the acting performances are overall stunning. Yet, somehow, the wholesome simply doesn't feel as astounding and refreshingly original as it should. It's a good film, but in case you're familiar with obscure, often low-budgeted and apocalyptic themed B-movies of the late 70's/early 80's, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's script has surprisingly little new stuff to offer you. Several of the main story lines in \"Children of Men\", like the infertility of the human race or Britain being the last remaining place of civilization (although\u0085), are often just smaller footnotes in Sci-Fi flicks of the old days. The first 30 or so minutes of the film are the absolute greatest. Chaotic images of several of the largest and most prominent cities of the world burning down, fascist soldiers aggressively preventing immigrants from entering the UK and a \u0096 downright brilliant \u0096 sub plot about the last born human being bombarded to a media figure and he himself, 19 years old, not able to cope with the unwanted attention. The real plot kicks off when Theo Feron, a totally antipathetic loner, is requested \u0096 commanded actually \u0096 by his ex girlfriend to escort a very special girl to safety because she carries in her womb the fetus that could represent mankind's final little string of hope for survival. Their journey together is long, full of lethal obstacles and literally no one can be trusted. At least as far as I'm concerned, \"Children of Men\" is definitely a showcase of style over substance. What distinguishes this film from the rest is Cuar\u00f3n's extremely raw and uncompromising filming style. The cinematography is everything but fancy, with shaky camera movements and disturbing visuals, the characters are uncanny and behave utterly nihilistic and the action is merciless. Clive Owen, definitely one of the coolest and most talented breakthrough actors since the new Millennium, gives another stellar performance.

{"review": "I finished the year is despair, because though I've seen many good films this year, I've seen very few actually released in 2006. What a surprise to discover some late in the game.This is one, and it really surprised me. That's because though I generally regard Hispanic filmmakers as the vanguard, he hasn't really impressed \u0097 not as a major talent. My how he impresses now. This isn't just an effective film, its effective in ways that show he really understands some of the theoretical mechanics.Here's what I mean. I was greatly impressed by the opening scene of \"Casino Royale.\" But if you look at it closely, you'll see that someone could have produced it by mere extrapolation. All they have to do is look at examples of things that are exciting in current movies and do the same, except a little more intensively.But what Cuaron has done is go back to first principles. He knows how Welles redefined space. He knows how Tarkovsky created a whole new sort of eye by making the camera drift. He knows how Kirosawa invented the notion of layered planes. He's synthesized these in a new way, it seems to me. It isn't radical enough to not be readily digestible to a modern film-goer. But it also isn't much like what we had before, which I may typify with Ridly Scott's \"Blackhawk Down.\" There's a scene toward the end which I imagine was where he started to imagine this project. Our escaping couple are detailed on the street by those who have been chasing them. This group is ambiguously evil, perhaps even the good guys. They prepare to kill Owen's character and perhaps do. From that point until near the end that seems to be one continuous shot. It isn't, but it seems to be, \"Rope\" -like.He runs down the street and around a corner, being shot at. He runs into a bus and out. Then across the street in the middle of heavy combat where a building is under attack. All this is hand-held using a partially-stabilized camera, halfway between a documentarian's camera (at this point blood is spattered on the lens), and the other way toward stylized distance that surveys the planes of the spaces while they are animated with bullet hits.We then follow him into the building, up several flights and down hallways to retrieve his \"family,\" then on out again. At this point he becomes \"seen\" by those around him. Before, he was more like us, there but disembodied, in a die hard sense. Now he becomes part of the texture and we later discover, wounded.So on down and out of the building to be adored, as Joseph the partner of the Maddona and then a tank explodes and we are back into the space, leading to a tunnel, an expanse of water, and then something else.Its so wonderfully choreographed, the camera, the narrator's stance, the dancing walls, the object that appear and vaporize, the shifting types of engagement among us, characters and place...We know we are being set up. This is no Terry Gilliam who basically intuits. Before this scene we see all the bits from the other masters presented separately. The Tarkovsky bits were perhaps less meditative that I would have liked. One was a visit to an abandoned school where we see our mother outside through a hole in the window, and encounters happen that \"break emotional walls.\" The other is the presence of a profoundly senile old woman, and how she is included.You walk through other basic film vocabularies elsewhere until they all combine in this last sequence. A Kurosawa episode on a bus when the midwife is taken to meet her fate.Quite apart from the visual vocabulary, he's done well with complementary notions of story. Its science fiction but without tedious explanations. The world just is. There's brutality as in the future of \"Vendetta,\" but one can see it isn't religious wars or jingoism that fuels it, but a far deeper existential concern. Julianne's character is the grand motivator, though wonderfully (in terms of story mechanics) she disappears early, effectively launching the real story: our hero is a storymaker.Noir. Regular readers know I define noir a bit different than ordinarily. It has to do with ordinary folks thrust into extraordinary situations as if the existence of the viewer motivates a capricious fate that weaves and frames a story for our eye. What we have here is ambiguous noir, and the first real action noir. Quite an achievement. Quite an experience.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.", "helpfulness": 0.5967741935483871}
{"review": "I was really looking forward to this movie . I do like British dystopian / apocalyptic movies which have been in vogue for the last few years , think 28 DAYS/WEEKS LATER , V FOR VENDETTA etc and CHILDREN OF MEN was very well regarded by the critics even picking up a couple of Bafta awards and three Oscar nominations . Three Oscar nominations for a dystopian apocalyptic movie ! This means it's gotta be a great movie right ? Unfortunately it's not It did have the potential to be a great movie but what ruins it is the lack of any type of internal or external logic . The human race has been sterile for 20 years so humanity will become extinct . Don't you think the sharpest minds in the world will go out of their way to find a cure for sterility ? They've even found a cure for this in real life and have done so for many years , it's called IVF treatment , something that is conveniently forgotten in this vision of the future Even worse is the confusing idea that because we're dying out the British government has become fascist and they're stamping down on illegal immigrants . I'm sorry but if Britain is an island why don't the government just block the channel tunnel and search every boat docking in the country ? Surely that's a much better sensible idea than allowing the scenario seen here ? Not allowing illegal immigrants on to an island ( Whilst allowing immigrants with much needed skils to stay ) merely takes some political will combined with some common sense and would be a vote winner with the indigenous electorate regardless of voters ethnicity so why the need of fascism when you can have populist democratic government ? There's also something else wrong with this premise - why does the slow extinction of mankind lead to so much nihilism ? Put it like this: you've been diagnosed with a terminal illness meaning you have a few years to live so how would you live out your time ? Would you face the future with dignity and calm going about your life as you always have or would you become entirely apathetic about life or would you use the time you have embarking on hedonism ? I think most people would choose one of these options but very few people would genuinely become violent apocalyptic nihilists as seen here It's been said that Alfonso Cuaron doesn't like to explain narrative turns similar to Michelangelo Antonio and it shows . The characters are often underdeveloped and their motives are often unclear. Like the government we never find out what motivates the terrorists and apart from casting Julianne Moore and Michael Caine in a rather cynical attempt to bump up the box office is their any reason for their characters to exist in the screenplay ? Neither Julian or Jasper contribute anything to the confused plot Having said all this Cuaron excels in the visuals . The grimy London of the future is certainly memorable while the battle scene towards the end is right there with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN . Also well done is the ambush in the countryside with the burning car and it's those scenes that will linger long in the memory long after you've forgotten the often risible screenplay All in all CHILDREN OF MEN is a very frustrating , flawed film . It's by no means the masterpiece many claim it is . It's interesting how many American critics enjoyed it . Could it be that America is more religious in its outlook and recognised an ecclesiastical subtext to the story such as having the protagonist called Theodore who sacrifices his life for the future of mankind ? Perhaps , but this screenplay won an Oscar nomination and if anyone thinks is a great screenplay then gawd help us all", "helpfulness": 0.5528455284552846}
{"review": "I don't even want to review this movie, but it hasn't even come out and somehow half of the ratings are one star. The movie itself is pretty great and I'd highly recommend you go see it when it comes out. The acting is very strong, the directing feels very fresh/unique, and you really grow to care about the film's romance. The political statements this movie makes are secondary to the story of these well-fleshed out characters and their struggles, which makes the commentary resonate stronger than many other movies like this. It ain't perfect --it's a bit long, especially when considering the repetitive structure of the story, and the shot composition is a bit boring  but this is a movie that everyone should go and see. And jesus, I don't know how it would be possible, butcan you not find a way to weed out the people who review-bomb movies with strong political messages/that have minorities or women in the leading roles?

{"review": "This movie is infuriating because it has so much potential. The setup is promising and both actors have enough pull to take you along for the ride. Daniel Kaluuya is a great actor of our times, he carries the screen so well with his eyes and expression. For me, the movie fails in it's editing and pacing, especially past the halfway point. The movie feels about 40 minutes too long. In the beginning, the characters' decision to go on the run feels very haphazard, especially considering Queen's profession. Some of the main character decisions are remarkably dumb and certain other side characters take decisions that are unlike them. Without going into spoilers, all I can say is that this movie is just too slow paced and does not fulfil a promise of what could have been a great fugitive movie with a strong social message.", "helpfulness": 0.6167979002624672}

{"review": "A Tinder date goes awry when Angela and Ernest (striking beauty Jodie Turner-Smith and Get Out's Daniel Kaluuya) are pulled over by a racist cop and wind up shooting him in self-defence. Realising they're in deep trouble, the couple go on the run, making a desperate bid for Florida, and then Cuba, before they are apprehended by the law.African American drama Queen & Slim would have us all believe that the bond between black people is so strong that they will happily harbour fugitives from the law simply because they share the same skin colour (reward money be damned). Hell, even a black police officer is willing to risk his career to allow the armed-and-dangerous couple to slip away unnoticed, even though they're wanted for cop-killing. To be honest, it borders on the farcical at times. Still, no wonder Angela and Ernest (they're never actually called Queen and Slim in the film) blindly trust the decidedly dodgy looking guy with the gold teeth at the end; he's black as well, so based on previous experience he should be on the level too, right? Or maybe, just maybe, he's the exception that proves the rule.The script for this black Thelma & Louise/Bonnie & Clyde fugitive flick is chock full of hard-to-swallow happenings, the couple making stops on their flight to freedom to partake in a burger, have a dance, ride a horse, visit a cemetery, make love, recklessly leap from a high window (as opposed to lowering themselves as far as possible and then letting go), hand their only firearm to a flaky looking gas station attendant, and lean out of the car window as they drive along (not the most inconspicuous behaviour for people on the lam!). Somehow they evade capture the whole way, even popping in at a service garage to have the radiator on their car fixed (luckily for them, the establishment is owned by yet another black man unwilling to inform the law).As the couple continue their journey, they become folk heroes for the African American community, who rise up against police brutality and racism, which results in the film's most unlikely moment: a young black lad (the mechanic's son) joins a protest and shoots a black policeman in the face for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Still, it's no more perplexing than the many poor decisions made by Angela and Ernest, the last of which costs them their lives.It might sound like I'm being unjustly harsh on this film, but I wanted to like Queen & Slim a lot more, I really did. It looks great and both lead actors put in solid performances, but the script requires much 'tightening up' for it to work, not least because, in it's present state, the film runs at a way-too-long 131 minutes.4.5/10, rounded up to 5 for IMDb.

I would have opened the car door and thrown her out.The road trip element kept us interested and was reminiscent of Thelma and Louise in its haphazardness.The music was good.What was totally hashedThe plot - The nasty tinder date led to being stopped by the police, they had swerved in the car, and this led the policeman, quite rightly believing he was driving under the influence of drink and/or drugs. I have been stopped and I complied to the letter the instructions the policeman gave me. Why would you antagonise/backchat/sass a man with a gun. We had an almost identical scene in The Hate U Give, and it is just an incoherent plot.The choices - as a lawyer she knew with the camera footage she had a good chance of arguing her case in court, she knew she could never run so why did she try. Quite ridiculous!The tone - much of the plot was comedic and was not specifically a issue led race movie, but towards the end it became inferred the whole movie was about race, well it wasn't as a black cop was gunned down as well. It really was neither fish nor fowl.There was a good deal of stylistic elements that distracted from the drama for example the cutting between the sex scene and the protest march.Lastly the ending was quite moronic they clearly were unarmed and so would not have been gunned down, this was no Bonnie & Clyde or Butch Cassidy.Lastly I have had a gutful of issue led movies that demonise men, white people, politicians, policemen, equality, social security etc. Hollywood is just not best placed to contrive a drama to raise these issues as it is all so unbalanced.", "helpfulness": 0.43005181347150256}

This time the tables turn and we have a hurt, broken (rightfully so) black woman together with an innocent naive black man, leading him down a path that she knows will end in death, and he eventually reaches that same conclusion.\nAs the the film moves on, you realize she needs this adventure and connection to another human being and her past to reconcile who she is. The silly delays of the 2nd date, riding a horse and running out of gas twice reminds you that these are not career criminals, but 2 humans trying to find a way out of a situation that can never be. Literally living everyday like it's their last.\nThe support they received along the way is uplifting and the end is beautiful and heartbreaking. This parallels the Joker in that a faction of society that is forgotten and devalued can gravitate and uplift that which will give them a voice.\nThe movie does do a great job at getting you connected with the characters however it did give me unreasonable hope and anxiety considering they're doomed from the start.\nWhen we see the waitress deliver the food to Queen and Slim you just assume it's a normal regular movie but the minute Queen opens her mouth to Slim from that moment on it's pure reality and I love it, its literally today's world and I had a good time seeing it. It's the perfect date movie for today's generation, it's kind of like Do The Right Thing for this generation.The only disappointing part was how they put their trust into a nut who lived in a trailer to get them on a plane to Cuba.

{"review": "This is my first ever review. I looked forward to watching this film because I thought it had the potential to be an empowering agent of change in the narrative of Black people and our relationship with law enforcement. It failed terribly.I was disappointed that in the end the viewer is left with the image of two bloodied black bodies (both unarmed) shot dead by a barrage of white police. Without going into much detail that would give away the movie I will give what I believe could have been a more powerful plot line.Queen is a defense attorney. Instead of going on an unrealistic \"run\" from the police I thought that maybe this production team would have given this character an opportunity to use her intellectual capacity as a defense attorney in a court of law to fight and WIN the murder charge. Queen and Slim being ALIVE and FREE at the end of this movie as opposed to DEAD and GONE would finally be a cinematic victory for Black people not only in America but throughout the diaspora.But, Hollywood is always going to be Hollywood and in order to green light productions that try to deal with race relations (particularly between Black people and law enforcement) there is going to always be the compromise.

{"review": "It got under First time feature director Melina Matsoukas's skin that some critics compared her Queen & Slim to Bonnie & Clyde, despite the fact that one of her characters in the film likens her on the lam protagonists to the notorious 30s bank robbers. Matsoukas was peeved precisely because her Queen & Slim \"heroes\" were innocent victims in contrast to the amoral depression era criminals who suddenly earned (obviously unwarranted) folk hero status following the release of Arthur Penn's classic film in 1967.\nNonetheless Matsoukas was probably justified in her anger over such a specious comparison. Instead, Queen & Slim are characters much more akin to Thelma & Louise, the on the lam duo from another classic film (this time from 1991) who acted in self-defense. Indeed, the idea of an innocent person or persons, falsely accused and on the run, can be the stuff of great suspense and compelling drama.\nIt begins with a Tinder blind date between Ernest \"Slim\" Hines (Daniel Kaluuya) and Angela \"Queen\" Johnson (Jodie Turner-Smith), an African-American couple who have little in common (Queen is a sassy lawyer and Slim a regular salt-of-the-earth guy). Slim is making no headway in the romance department with Queen until they're interrupted by a Caucasian officer of the law who stops them on the false pretext of a second of erratic driving. Before you know it, the psycho cop shoots Queen (she suffers a graze wound to the leg) with Slim grabbing the cop's gun and shooting and killing him in self-defense.\nEventually we'll discover that Matsoukas and Waithe are advancing the thesis that the officer depicted here is actually representative of most officers, who they maintain are both racists and psychopaths. A cursory glance at many of these white cop versus African-American encounters however, reveals that they aren't so always \"black and white.\" Usually it's more like overly jumpy cops mistaking a cell phone for a gun, resulting in tragedy.\nBefore it becomes clear that the film's scenarists are trying to make a big statement about racism, I was quite willing to accept their psycho racist cop as possibly a \"bad apple.\" Indeed their depiction of him is quite scary and realistic and I am quite willing to concede there might be a few of these \"bad apples\" out there.\nBut I wasn't convinced at all by what happens next by a longshot. Indeed Queen, the supposedly \"smart\" attorney, decides that she and Slim should go on the lam and not immediately turn themselves in to the authorities. Their reasoning is that no one will believe a black person who has just killed a cop. Queen (perhaps caught in a time warp) decides to channel Assata Shakur (aka Joanne Chesimard); it's her idea that she and Slim should flee to Cuba (when was the last time that happened? Probably 1979, given the completely different political climate).\nAnd does it really make sense that Queen would resort to such a ludicrous plan of driving all the way from Ohio to Florida, in the hope that they'll be able to secure a safe flight to Cuba? What's more, within a day or so, dash cam footage has been broadcast all over the US depicting Queen and Slim having acted in self-defense. And not only that, they've become folk heroes in the black community as evidenced by all the people who appear to recognize them (and hold them up as heroes). So why wouldn't they turn themselves in?\nFor a while, Queen & Slim proceeds like a Hitchcock suspense thriller. There's quite a bit of suspense when they escape from the sheriff and lock him in the trunk and then show up at Queen's uncle Earl's house in New Orleans. Earl, a pimp, is perhaps the best character here (played by an excellent Bokeem Woodbine). But the backstory of him and Queen also doesn't ring true.\nThe whole idea that Earl murdered Queen's mother and she ended up defending him in a court of law hardly seems realistic. Despite all of Queen's sassiness, Matsouka's ultimate strategy is to present Queen as a veritable saint-that's why she has created this unlikely backstory of Queen defending her uncle. The whole scenario also doesn't ring true because the first place the cops would be looking for Queen is at her uncle's place (after all, she probably would have gotten a great deal of publicity in the past for defending an uncle who murdered her mother!).\nSlim also is afforded saintly status by emphasizing his religious nature (he has license plate that reads \"TrustinGod\"). And he's so good and trusting that he gives the gun-obsessed hillbilly his firearm in exchange for the gas money (while the hillbilly ludicrously marvels at the gun and gives it back to him, instead of holding him at gunpoint until the police arrive).\nMatsoukas completely loses it when she ridiculously juxtaposes a scene of Queen & Slim's lovemaking with a protest over their unjust treatment. And when Junior, the mechanic's son, shoots the good black cop, the suggestion is that police racism is so all-encompassing, it will even drive impressionable black youth to turn on their own.\nQueen & Slim are essentially \"crucified\" in the grand finale when the police gun the two \"saints\" both down without provocation. Worse yet there is a black Judas who has sold them out. Instead of a suspense thriller, Matsoukas and company would prefer to preach to the choir of the disaffected, the oppressed who now revel in becoming the oppressors, serving up a cold dish of payback in revenge for years of discrimination at the hands of the white establishment.", "helpfulness": 0.4645161290322581}

If they do, they are washed out of the job before they are off training. The academy and the FTO process are extremely difficult to pass and it the point of it is to weed people like that out of the job. A few other things: Cops do not use sirens to make traffic stops! They are for emergency stops only. Why do movies/tv shows continue to do this? Cops do not search vehicles for simple traffic offenses. This man had valid paperwork and either would have gotten a ticket or been sent away with a warning. Cops would not pull their weapon for someone saying they are cold.

{"review": "First Hit: This film failed to deliver on its potential.The potential in this film is to tell the story about how people of color are targeted for police harassment and random shootings. It failed to make this the central and poignant topic and the primary focus of the movie. Instead, it took a compelling beginning and turned it into a story about two people searching for someone who'll love them the way they want to be loved.That's not to say that a love story based on a horrible event isn't unusual, but with our country's problems of race, it seemed like this story had the potential to tell us something about where we've gone wrong. Instead, it became the side story.Slim (Daniel Kaluuya) and Queen (Jodie Turner-Smith) meet on a Tinder date. Their differences are immediately evident as she's well dressed, proper in manners, slow to share personal stuff, and an attorney. He's dressed down more, a bit lazy in table manners, open, and is very close with his family.The conversation at the table is a kind jab and parry type and with a sense of respect. Giving her a ride home, she steals his phone and, in an attempt, to grab it back, Slim yanks the steering wheel and the car swerves.They are stopped by a policeman who is belligerent and pushy in his actions and requests towards Slim. As a lawyer, Queen takes umbrage to the policeman's behavior and talks back to him. She tells him that she's an attorney, and he has no right to be doing what he's doing to Slim. Slim, on the other hand, is compliant and even lets the officer search his trunk. Queen points out that the cop has no cause to do this, a scuffle ignites, the policeman draws his gun, fires, and hits Queen in the leg. Slim knocks the policeman down, the weapon falls loose and Slim picks it up and shoots the officer in the head.The officer dies, and Queen convinces Slim to make a run for it.That's the premise. The rest of the film is about how the black community looks up to these outlaws and their admiration for them standing up to the law. In support, many aid them in escaping the manhunt. They meet up with people who help them along the way and end up finding a connection to fly them out of Florida and on to Cuba where they will live for the rest of their lives. That's the plan.The edge created by the opening scenes is lost as the film drifts off into a love story with their deed becoming a side story and only there to keep them running - together.Kaluuya was alright in this role. It seemed to me that the lost direction in this story took away several possibilities. Turner-Smith was excellent as Queen. Again, the film's story veered away from what could have been a powerful statement. Bokeem Woodbine, as Queen's Uncle Earl, was terrific. His arguments with his live-in girlfriends were amusing. Lena Waithe wrote this mediocre screenplay that ended up focusing on being a love story and not about what brought these two together.

{"review": "First off I'll say that seeing Jordan Peele's name on the credits and the trailer set my standards really high. And for the first half or so the film genuinely did seem interesting. There's no real conflicting values going on. As soon as Ron's love interest starts to question him, he just gives his view and they walk off. And then after the explosion, they're happy again. What. At the initial rally with the black activist it seemed like a genuine internal moral conflict would start to brew, with the way the scene was paced and the great acting from Corey Hawkins. But nope, nothing was jeopardized; nothing happened. Every single time something seems to go wrong everyone just walks it off. The lack of character development was just plain annoying.The pacing was just awful as well. When the car with the klansmen was driving to the house near the end, there was no change in music, or even camera angles. They give you this enormous build-up with the whole meeting with David Duke and the seemingly botched plan, but it only ends up with an explosion that solves the whole problem. No sense of suspense or intensity at all, even though there was a bloody bomb involved. The scene was saved when the police mistook Ron for a rapist, but again, the scene was too slow and there was no atmosphere. What I thought was the climax with the old man's story once again didn't end with anything. I feel like this film was just taking the piss out of my expectations and robbing me of any enjoyment.And yeah, I did expect a stylish, fast-paced Tarantino-esque flick. But that's not even the issue. Everything is SO in-your-face, there's no interpretation left to the viewer, no hidden message or symbolism. The dialogue just straight up tells the audience what's going on. No sense of mystery, suspense or viewer involvement.And then the last part with the current footage was just milking it. Maybe it's because I don't live in the US. but it was just such an awkward watch, especially the flag bit. I'm surprised that was really the only violent part of the film.I think more people are too concerned with the message (which is of course legitimate and current), that they forget about actually being entertained.

{"review": "There's much good about this movie, starting with Ron Stallworth's incredible deception of the Klu Klux Klan. Racism in all its ugliness is powerfully shown. There's a lot of humor at the expense of some really dumb people. \nUnfortunately, there's a lot wrong with the movie too. Most of this is because the director embellished the true story. I'm not a big fan of directors tinkering with what really happened in order to add their own touch, and then still claim \"based on a true story\".\nThe result of the tinkering is a very uneven movie, particularly in the apparently \"easy\" parts of infiltrating the KKK and the \"hard\" parts where things go wrong. The \"easy\" parts are, remarkably, mostly the true story. Apparently this wasn't dramatic enough, so a lot of fictional \"hard\" parts were added to build tension including whole characters and situations. That's bad enough, but the added parts often made no sense, such as having no real origin (like one character's intense suspicions) and no resolution to the dilemma presented - they just seem to go away, are forgotten or have no effect on the inevitable story arc. Many seem to have been thrown in only to make already duped people look even more ridiculous. \nThe characters themselves are, with a few exceptions, just caricatures. It's not hard to figure out what's next since they do exactly what you expect.\nEventually the movie just got boring since it all moved to an inevitable and very easy to see end. Ultimately, the movie is maybe an hour of an amazing true and humorous story marred by over an hour of superfluous and poorly executed fiction.", "helpfulness": 0.6185133239831697}
{"review": "Spike Lee has created an almost unimaginably uneven career in films, but it has never been in doubt, that he is one of the most talented American filmmakers of his generation. And should you have forgotten that, now you can remind yourself by watching the amazing \"BlacKkKlansman\", which won the Grand Prix at Cannes in May.\"BlacKkKlansman\" tells the true story of a rookie African American police officer who in the 70's infiltrated in the KKK, but that's certainly not what the movie is about. Lee tackles head-on the contemporary hot topics of racism, the police killing black Americans, and white supremacy to create an overwhelming pamphlet about the American identity - which has been hurled into a state of great confusion after the last presidential election.Movies don't come much more political as this one. In a way, \"BlacKkKlansman\" is a companion piece to \"The Post\" - a movie that similarly discussed the current political climate in a 70's setting - but with loads more of blackness, humour, anger and attitude. It's a better movie, too.Though not perfect. Form-wise, \"BlacKkKlansman\" is sometimes paced oddly and feels needlessly long: not overlong, exactly, because you're not going to be bored for a minute. Visually it could have used a little more of the delicious textures typical of those 70's blacksploitations it makes references to.But Lee is such a virile storyteller, that you can't help but get sucked in it all. And he has SO much to say. \"BlacKkKlansman\" is at its savage best when putting in perspective the official holier-than-thou image of the white Americans: Harry Belafonte cameos as an eye-witness of the beastly lynching of Jesse Washington in 1916.Actors in \"BlacKkKlansman\" are great. John David Washington excels in the lead role. Adam Driver signs what is arguably his best role to date. Ryan Eggold is terrific as the local boss of the KKK, and the Finnish Jasper P\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6nen impresses as his right hand man. The biggest surprise of all is Topher Grace, who is near-ingenious as David Duke, a well-mannered bag of sleaze in a three-piece.\"BlacKkKlansman\" is an incredibly rich and stirring piece of contemporary cinema with enough stuff to fuel a conversation for hours.

{"review": "I'd love to thank the Adelaide Film Festival Film Club for the free advance screening for this review.Blackkklansman comes to us from Director Spike Lee & Producer Jordan Peele and tells the true story of Ron Stallworth, the first african-american police officer in Colorado Springs infiltrating the Klu Klux Klan.To achieve this he enlists the help of a fellow officer played by Adam Driver to pose as him in person while Ron handled the phone calls and planning. This film is biographical in nature but has some fantastic storytelling, looking at the trailers, it looked like a really fun time with some funny humour about the time period and racism.\nI'm glad to report this isn't just some comedy movie, here we have a rare film that manages to be funny and outlandish at times but at the same time drives home a serious emotional message, Spike Lee should absolutely be commended for this because it was executed flawlessly. John David Washington gives an interesting quirky performance here and nails it perfectly, Adam Driver turned out to be much more involved in the story than I had anticipated and has some really great moments.I have never had a cinema experience quite like this, for instance at the tail end of the film, in the space of 10 minutes the entire audience in my screening went from laughing and some perfectly executed comedic dialogue to utter still silence in absolute awe, frozen & horrified by what was appearing on screen, this silence went on for a few moment even after the fade to black and an applause started up. This film had me thinking about what I had seen for a long, long time afterward and I am still thinking about it almost every second.Blackkklansman really shows the Klan for what they really are, and highlights the good work of an amazing african-american police officer. The supporting cast does a great job here, Topher Grace as David Duke was an insanely good performance and I can imagine how hard it would be to embody that particular character and Laura Harrier plays off of Washington beautifully.In addition there is a great cameo at the beginning of this film, be on the look out!Blackkklansman is easily in my top 10 for 2018 so far and I urge you all to go see it in cinemas, small warning though, there are some quite confronting images in this film, they are hard to watch but I think that it should be watched as that is the intention here.\nBlackkklansman is out in cinemas August 17th.", "helpfulness": 0.5711711711711712}

It has bad mix between comedy and serious parts. Maybe jokes are too rare or to plain, but it makes you struggle to understand what was directors intentions? \n4. End scenes (this is kinda spoiler, so will not say what was in it) felt really biased and ruined last bits of movie, because it felt too much out of place.

Unfortunately that potential was thrown away when Spike Lee took the original events and tryed to spin it to confirm his own political views.Now don't get me wrong it's perfectly fine if you want to make a movie with a political message, but if you do so you should at least make sure the dialogue is well written, so that it feels as though it's a character speaking and not the director. But apparently Spike Lee doesn't understand this which has resulted in most of the characters just being Spike Lee himself.Another big issue I had was the jokes seemed to get old really fast. This was because most of them amounted to \"Ha Ha he's actually black\" or \"Look at how stupid these white people are\". The movie was also incredibly bland as far as the cinematography goes, as most shots were just shot reverse shot. Almost nothing visually interesting happened at all, until the end. But at that point the shots were just so bland and uninteresting it just felt forced.The one plus side in my opinion would be the performances, because although the dialogue is not well written the actors do a great job delivering their lines with sincerity.

You know how every black person's going to behave and you know how every white person's going to behave. And of course they do.John David Washington can act, but his character, like all the other characters, is little more than a cartoon stereotype, this time with a wig on his head that looks like a microphone pop-shield.

I love movies also, and while the two often compliment each other, sometimes I'm repelled. It's probably the dancing. A person breaking into a complicated dance number, seemingly unaware of their surroundings, or worse yet, in complete synch with a complete stranger is like making fun of the movie, as if to say, \"Please don't take us seriously, we like to sing and dance.\" Or even more ridiculous, \"Let's not fight, let's settle this dispute with a song and dance.\" Forget about suspension of disbelief.This film however, I manage to enjoy. I once was given the task of my film teacher to watch the film and keep track of all the cuts in the film. Well, sometime after ten minutes I lost track because I was so wrapped up in the story. It really is an interesting period in the history of cinema, told well, and with well placed song and dance numbers that at times drag on, but that seems to be more of an excuse to show off the technicolour than anything else. They build you up to it slowly. The first few numbers don't break out at an inappropriate time. It doesn't last though, but by then they've got you.With such memorable tunes as these, it's hard to imagine them going wrong. When Gene Kelly sings the title piece, somehow time stands still as you're swept up in one of the most memorable scenes in film history. Just reading the title in print has likely caused you to hum a few bars, or sing a few words. Or maybe, just maybe, walk out without an umbrella when you know it's raining. One thing's for sure, if all Gene Kelly did was choreograph the dance numbers, he more than deserves the co-directing credit he has.They simply don't make films like this anymore. Which in some ways is a testament to the film's theme and narrative. The business of show is constantly in a state of evolution. The narrative portrays a time period when silent films were being replaced by \"talkies\" with sound, yet the musical genre itself has almost all but disappeared with the exception of animated films with musical numbers, and rare live-action pieces.One might speculate that Hollywood overdid the musical. Personally, I can't get into them. Most of the time it seems like a drawn out affair, but this film is something special.

{"review": "Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are a famed Hollywood duo, making films at the tail end of the silent era. The studio has been issuing PR suggesting that they're a romantic item. In reality, they can barely stand one another. One night, while on the town with his best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O' Connor), Lockwood has to run to escape fans who want a piece of him badly enough that they'll literally rip his clothes to shreds. He hops over a number of moving vehicles and ends up in the passenger seat of Kathy Selden's (Debbie Reynolds) car. Lockwood seems immediately taken with her, but she gives him the cold shoulder. She says she's an actress with a love of theater, and she looks down on film acting. Later, Lockwood discovers that she was inflating the truth a bit, as he sees Selden performing as a cute song & dance girl at an industry party he's attending. She runs out of the party and Lockwood chases after her, but he's too late. While he tries to track her down, he, Lamont and their studio have to deal with the changing nature of film in 1927--made much more difficult by the fact that Lamont may look glamorous, but she talks more like Fran Drescher in \"The Nanny\" (1993).Aside from the more serious aspects of the plot, Singing in the Rain is a great success as a romance and a musical. It also has an astoundingly rich Technicolor look, and it is charmingly humorous. Kelly and Reynolds click on screen, even if offscreen Kelly, who also co-directed and co-choreographed, was famously difficult to work with--he drove Reynolds so hard (she was a much more inexperienced dancer) that her feet literally started bleeding at one point. The songs are great, they're worked into the story well--which is perhaps surprising given that most of them weren't written specifically for this film--and the choreography is impeccable, frequently jaw dropping and always aesthetically wondrous and sublime. If for nothing else, the film is worth a look for its often-athletic dance numbers, which can resemble Jackie Chan's showy martial arts stunts as much as dancing. It's also imperative viewing for cultural literacy in the realm of film.But the more serious aspects of the plot are fascinating as well. In a significant way, Singing in the Rain is about film technology. Film technology is the hinge of the plot, after all. The climax and d\u00e9nouement are decided by the advent of synchronized sound in the film industry. We see studio head R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) demonstrating sound films at the party where Lockwood sees Selden for the second time, providing two big turning points at once. There are sequences of actors heading off to diction coaches, as happened in reality once sound entered the scene, and also in reality as in the film some actor's careers were jeopardized by having to suddenly master a new skill.But Singing in the Rain is about technology on another level, too. Kelly and co-director Stanley Donen go to great lengths to ensure that the film is an exemplar of state-of-the-art film technology in 1952. For example, the beautiful Technicolor cinematography is emphasized by the fabulously colorful costumes and production design--they're showing off cutting edge color. The sound is as good as it could be in 1952, and the fact that this is a musical helps show that off. The sets and effects are complex and an attempt is made to show them off as well.Donen and Kelly often play up the artificiality of the sets and effects to emphasize artistry and technology. This is clearly shown in the \"Make 'Em Laugh\" sequence (and surrounding events) and the extended \"Broadway Rhythm Ballet\" sequence with Cyd Charisse. Showing off this artistry and technology also occurs very subtly, as with the rain in the \"Singing in the Rain\" sequence. Even today, rain machines are frequently employed in a way that it appears to be raining on film, but in reality, it's just enough coverage to produce the illusion. In the \"Singing in the Rain\" sequence, they make sure that you can see the whole area is getting flooded, and they use Gene Kelly's umbrella, as torrents of water bounce off of it, to emphasize that no matter where he goes, \"rain\" is pouring down on him.While there are many musicals I like as much as Singing in The Rain, this is one of the better-loved examples of that genre, and for good reason. Any musical lover has surely seen this already, and if not, they should run out now and pick it up on DVD.

Problem is Lina has a voice that can cut glass and doesn't like lockwood falling for Selden...This movie has one highlight after another. Almost all the numbers are great--the title tune, \"Make 'Em Laugh\", \"Beautiful Girl\", \"Good Morning\" on and on. My two favorites are two short ones: \"Fit as a Fiddle\" which has incredible dancing from Kelly and O'Connor and \"Would You?\" at the end. Kelly isn't that good acting (he never was) but his dancing is superb; Reynolds (only 19 when she did this) is beautiful, energetic and full of life; Hagen is uproarious as Lamont (she was nominated for an Academy Award--she should have won!) and O'Connor is just great as Cosmo (his \"Make Em' Laugh\" number has astounding dancing). It's hard to believe that Reynolds and O'Connor hated working with Kelly (he was obnoxious, VERY demanding and a tyrant)--it's a credit to their acting that it never comes through.I only have one (small) complaint--the big, elaborate production number with Cyd Charisse in the middle. It LOOKS great and colorful--but it brings the film to a screeching halt and is way too long. After it ends I have trouble remembering where the film left off! Still, that's a small problem.

{"review": "Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen have produced the best musical written directly for the screen. They have used the period in film history during the transition to sound movies and embroidered it with the wonderful songbook of Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown. The icing on the cake, of course is the choreography of Kelly and Donen. From the first moment, the movie takes flight as Kelly relates the tale of his rise as a silent film star with his sidekick, the incomparable Donald O'Connor. Watch the flying feet of O'Connor and Kelly in the \"Fit as a Fiddle\" number. It doesn't get much better than this. Everyone is familiar with the classic \"Singin' in the Rain\" sequence. Donald O'Connor's hysterical \"Make 'em Laugh\" number is probably the funniest musical three minutes on film. Even the Broadway Ballet is a kaleidoscope of color and movement, with a minimum of the highbrow balletic choreography found in the later \"An American in Paris.\"What makes \"Singin'\" such an entertaining classic is its superb integration of comedy and music. Jean Hagen gives the performance of her life as the vocally challenged silent film star, Lena Lamont. Every scene she's in is a comic gem. Her \"fingernails on a blackboard\" voice and massacre of the English language make her a figure of ridicule. However, in the end when she finally gets her comeuppance, one can't help feeling a little sorry for her.This delightful film has been given its due on video. On VHS it can be purchased with the complete remastered soundtrack on CD. The laserdisc versions include one with commentary by film historian Ronald Haver (Criterion) and the film-only version from MGM/UA Home Video with a restored Dolby Digital stereo soundtrack., Last,but not least,is a masterful rendering on DVD with, unfortunately, no supplementary material to speak of.This is truly a film for all time that can be watched just for its entertainment value and studied as probably the apex of the Hollywood musical in its Golden Age.", "helpfulness": 0.7641509433962265}
{"review": "I'm going to confine my comments about \"Singin' in the Rain\" to the \"Broadway Rhythm\" sequence where Cyd Charisse steals the movie without saying a word. In my view, Charisse, who is still gorgeous at 83, was the quintessential movie dancer of the 1950s. Her height, elegance, aloofness and those impossibly long legs -- along with an uncanny ability to match her style to that of her partner -- makes watching her dance a mesmerizing experience.Many have said that the two numbers in \"Singin' in the Rain\" that feature Charisse probably belong in another movie. I don't know\u0085 as the flapper in jade, she sexes up Kelly's rube character to a steamy height unusual in movies of that era. In a dance full of wonderful moves, my favorite comes after she's left him with her cigarette holder. She sashays away from him, blowing on her nails in studied boredom. She's gotten some distance away, and as she tosses her right hand back, he throws down the cigarette holder, grabs her hand and brings her flying up to his chest, where she proceeds to slide down Kelly's thigh to the floor for one of several prone positions she takes during this duet, from which she returns to a standing position with amazing grace. I'm not wild about dances that rely heavily on props, but this one does so very effectively: they're amusing and they reinforce character.And thank heaven for the artistic control that allowed Kelly to keep the \"crazy veil\" number in the picture. Charisse has discussed that dance, where she got to show off her early ballet training, most charmingly for a \"Word of Mouth\" feature on TCM. She and others have noted over the years that the wind machines required to keep that impossibly long veil moving and undulating between and above her and Kelly made filming a nightmare. But it looks effortless, on a set that is a subtle optical illusion\u0097not as deep nor as sloped as it appears to be.Both dances end the same way. Whether she's a cheap gangster's moll in garish green or a Grecian goddess in white, less obviously in a mobster's sway, Charisse is invariably lured back to reality by proffered baubles and menacingly tossed coins. But at the end of the crazy veil number, she's the one tossing the coins.Wonderful.", "helpfulness": 0.7142857142857143}
{"review": "Singin' in the Rain is one of the best movies ever made. The film is beautiful, tuneful, and loads of fun. While it pokes fun at Hollywood it also does so with great love. Little bits and pieces of Hollywood lore find their way into this great film and it's a pleasure to get the joke or recognize the real star they're referring to.The star trio is just perfect: Gene Kelly give a funny performance as the hammy silent actor; Donald O'Connor makes the most of his \"second banana\" role; Debbie Reynolds is perfect as the ing\u00e9nue trying to break into films. The three stars perform many memorable numbers, including Kelly's \"Singin' in the Rain\" classic; all three in the \"Good Mornin'\" number; O'Connor's \"Make 'Em Laugh\"; and Kelly and Reynolds in \"You Were Meant for Me.\" The masterpiece however may be the \"Gotta Dance\" production number with Kelly and Cyd Charisse\u0097just perfect. Also great fun are O'Connor and Kelly in \"Fit as a Fiddle\" and \"Moses Supposes.\"There are of course other production numbers, including the montage that shows Hollywood's race to transition to talkies, a scene that ends in the \"Beautiful Girl\" number featuring Jimmy Thompson. Jean Hagen (as Lina Lamont) won an Oscar nomination and steals the film in a classic comedy performance. Also good are Millard Mitchell, Douglas Fowley, Rita Moreno, King Donovan, Kathleen Freeman, Mae Clarke, Julius Tannen, and Madge Blake.The great trick to this film is that while Reynolds is supposedly \"lip syncing\" for Hagen, it's really Hagen's voice that Reynolds is miming to as in the \"I Would, Would You\" number. The final miming act is Hagen mouthing \"Singin' in the Rain\" is really Reynolds. It gets so confusing you can't tell who is lip syncing whose voice.Lots of Hollywood lore retold in this film. Hagen's Lamont character is a veiled reference to Norma Talmadge, who supposedly failed in talkies because of her New York accent. It's also a reference to Louise Brooks, whose talkie debut in The Canary Murder Case was all dubbed. When Kelly screams \"I LOVE YOU\" it's a reference to John Gilbert in is talkie debut flop. His Glorious Night. Kathleen Freeman's diction coach character is a reference to Constance Collier, who returned to Hollywood as a coach.

{"review": "This is my favorite movie musical with no stage forebear.Consider what's in the mix: A cachet of songs, all tried-and-true from other movies. A cast that was at the top of its form, all the way from Kelly himself to the supporting leads played by Rita Moreno and Millard Mitchell. A script that is, at once, romantic and exciting and sharp and funny.Stir together with a generous heaping of MGM color and a dash of a director with a stellar pedigree and the result is, well, something like \"Singin' in the Rain.\"There's not a misstep in the movie's entire 103-minute running time. I love the pokes at early filmmaking (\"She never *did* figure out where that microphone was, boss!\") and the sheer energy of the musical numbers (\"Fit as a Fiddle,\" \"Good Mornin'\").Not only that, but there's not a more romantic scene in all of filmdom that can compare with Reynolds and Kelly dancing to \"You Were Meant for Me.\" Their side-by-side tap dancing says more about how they feel about each other than pages and pages of dialog.Great stuff!If you think this movie is just the sequence of Kelly splashing like a five-year-old in a puddle, you obviously haven't seen the entire film. Do so--now!

Thus, a star of the magnitude of Lina Lamont, suffers a hard blow to her career and ego.That's the basis of one of the best movies about old Hollywood of all times: \"Singin' in the Rain\". The film is one of the classics it is because of the marvelous direction of Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, two men who knew a lot about musicals. The screen play is by one of the best people in the business, Betty Comden and Adolph Green.MGM was the studio that employed all the stars one sees in the film, and what a cast they put together: Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen, Cyd Charisse in a dancing part, Millard Mitchell and Rita Moreno.

I found it so boring that I didn't care one bit what the ending was going to be - I was ready to go out for dinner, but my wife said she was at least curious to know the ending.It's musicals like \"Singin' in the Rain\" that help give musicals a bad rep amongst the young IMO - people bursting into cheesy, pointless songs, with ridiculous, goofy expressions on their faces while doing slapstick dance routines that make you want to cringe with embarrassment. It was all so silly - over-the-top acting at every turn, Cosmo's clowning around downright embarrassing, and some of the cheesiest effects imaginable in the dance routines.

This film has been called \"the best\" film musical of all time. I do not share that opinion.The characters were campy. Gene Kelly was far too happy all the time and it made it very difficult for me to watch him. The dumb blonde played by Jean Hagen was an exception. I found her to be very funny (apparently so did Frank Loesser in that he plagiarized her character in his musical \"How to Succeed at Business Without Really Trying\".) The supporting cast was fair and Debbie Reynolds was competent but I really see no reason to rave about this musical.I would take Fred Astaire over Gene Kelly any day for choreography. The story is rudely and abruptly interrupted by this ridiculous \"vision\" that Kelly has where he is suddenly on Broadway or at a burlesque show and this horrible dance sequence that lasted forever, all in the name of his character finding a good ending to their swashbuckling movie. From swashbuckler to Broadway is a bit of a stretch. Speaking of stretch, visions shouldn't take up half a movie in MY book.This movie was genuinely bad. I am sorry that this is considered a classic. I guess we can look for future generations to hail the Beegee's and Peter Frampton for their \"ingenious\" work when they name \"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" a musical \"classic\" as well.

{"review": "Spoilers herein.This is a nearly perfect film from my perspective: It feels naturally improvised. Its episodes are radically discontinuous, but feel like fluid transitions. It has some great numbers, including the incomparable Cyd Charisse.But what really puts this on my `must see' list is the deep self-reference. Superficially, it is a movie about a movie, but actually the folding is a whole lot more complex, even psychedelic. The narrative structure is flashbacks, flashforwards, about the movie, IS the movie, about the fooling behind the movie (oddly, Debbie's non-movie songs were dubbed by someone else!). It has nested abstractions, and encompassing ones. It has several manner of annotative features. And the internal movie itself grows while we watch to have internal nesting of different types: the original costume drama becomes a vision from a modern newcomer whacked on the head. And further, there is the Charisse number which is another abstraction.\nThere were precessors: `Kane' (41) introduced the use of many parallel narrative devices, `Children of Paradise' (45) had conflated reality and performance: `Red Shoes' (48) took it to dance, and those are must see as well.

Singin' in the Rain has its good moments but it is also a mess of a movie.The main romance in the film came out of nowhere. It has that age old clich\u00e9 where two people do not like each other at first but then fall in love, except the clich\u00e9 is done badly. The dislike is very sudden, feels very forced to the point that it seemed like the main female character could not act. After the initial dislike there is no natural progression to a warmer relationship. It just becomes a fact at one point so the romance also feels very sudden and forced.The story as a whole has a disorienting structure, getting interrupted by parts that do not belong.The film is saturated with little jokes and slapstick and almost none of that stuff is funny! After a while the dumb forced humour becomes painful. There is a character played by Donald O'Connor whose mission it is to be a harlequin that got high on speed. He has a good delivery and can be funny but he also overdoes the whole clown business to the point of his character becoming annoying.The actors are definitely capable when they want to be, they sing very well and they dance well too. But those 3 aspects (acting, singing and dancing) are not tied together well. Look, if you wanted to make some random songs, make an album and put it on a record. If you are making a film with a story then it has to make sense and the songs in it have to be related. That is not the case here.On top of that, the songs are not all good either. There are two songs, Singin' in the Rain and Good Morning (to a lesser degree), that are discernibly interesting. The rest are average, some with primitive rhymes and of questionable purpose in the movie. There is one song that starts for no apparent reason and is not about anything, with its few lyrics being nonsensical babble. It is several minutes of your life you will never get back. The song could have been cut out of the film and it would have lost NOTHING.Moreover, the music is constantly being interrupted either for a change in tune or for another scene or for a dancing part. I like tap dancing too but quitting and interrupting the music into which your brain is trying to tune feels horrible, like getting mentally slapped. These dancing parts are not brief pauses either; they last a while and they too get interrupted by slapstick or other dancing scenes. What a mess.As the movie was drawing to a close I was bored and tired of it (my partner tuned out after just 10 minutes). And that is despite the fact that certain parts of this film are bouncing of the wall hyperactive. The music is good, the acting is good, but the structure is wrong.

{"review": "Singin' in the rain is one musical that even the most devout of the musical haters in todays world cannot ignore. And speaking as a reviewer who generally dislikes musicals I feel it has everything a musical should have. The songs \"You are my lucky star\", \"Good morning\" and of course the title track are timeless classics to even the most cynical ear. The film also contains a lot of satirical humour which is aimed mainly at the attitudes of the Hollywood Film community of the 1920's. The film is about Don Lockwood and his onscreen (but certainly not offscreen) love Linda Lamont who are big box office movie stars of the silent era. Also in the background is Cosmo Brown who used to work with Lockwood onstage during their early musical careers before making a name for himself as a silent movie actor. But thanks to the success of a certain film called The Jazz Singer their silent world is about to get loud. The Jazz Singer because of its talking segments has stirred a lot of interest among the general public and the Hollywood moguls decide to start making \"Talkie\" vehicles for their biggest stars. At first the silent movie stars mock the idea of these talkies but they soon find themselves undergoing speech therapy and singing lessons. Don Lockwood successfully passes these tests but it is his co-star Linda Lamont who cannot make the transition to be a proper \"talkie\" actress.The Hollywood bosses decide to hire Kathy Selden who is a chorus girl to overdub Lamont's voice. But soon Lockwood falls for Kathy much to the dismay of Lamont who tries her best to break them up. Singin' in the rain features some of the greatest dance numbers ever filmed particularily during the \"Make 'Em Laugh\" segment which is performed by Donald O'Connor. That dance sequence alone is reason enough to see this film. And of course the title track during which Gene Kelly takes his most famous dance steps is also highly entertaining. And the film does contain plenty of humour especially in the scene where Don Lockwood describes his early musical career to the press as being glamourous and artistically stimulating while we see images of his past that contradict this fact by showing scenes of Cosmo and himself being pelted by angry punters in a small music hall. Though at times the humour is a little bit cruel as a lot of it is at the expense of the character of Lamont. Because of her annoying voice and inability to sing and dance she is constantly ridiculed in this film. The character of Lamont epitomises the actors and actresses who failed to transcend to the world of sound because many of them were from foreign countries who spoke with thick accents. These people were eventually cut loose by the Hollywood industry and many of them lived out their lives in poverty. The fact that this film mocks them by portraying Linda Lamont as an idiot villainess with a horrible irritating voice who deservedly gets pushed aside by the Hollywood Studios at the end of the movie appears to be quite an insult to their memory. These people were not talentless like the character of Linda Lamont they were artists of a different type of medium who suddenly couldn't catch up with the technological advances of Hollywood. This film also places an emphasis on the romantic interest between Lockwood and the chorus girl Kathy. This is very good in parts but there are at times when it doesn't gel together quite right. A snobby movie star of the 1920's would never get too serious with a humble chorus girl. It would have been more believable if Lockwood had been penned as a struggling movie actor himself. The film does have a rather weak ending which would stir up a lot of derision among people who dislike musicals. This is where Lockwood sings \"You are my lucky star\" to Kathy in an attempt to stop her angrily leaving a packed movie theatre. I think they should have just filmed Lockwood singing the song to Kathy alone without anyone else watching. This would have made the ending less cheesier to modern audiences.I would recommend this film to anyone whether they were a musical fan or not. This film along with Calamity Jane, Finian's rainbow and Grease are I feel the greatest musicals of all time.", "helpfulness": 0.5142857142857142}

The film never looked and sounded better!In a nutshell, the reason for the high praise, I would think would be: 1 - Likable lead characters (Debbie Reynolds, Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor); 2 - Excellent song-and-dance numbers, capped off by one of the most famous of all-time, the title song \"Singin' In the Rain,\" featuring Kelly; 3 - Very good humor throughout the film, aided by Jean Hagen's dumb blonde imitation, which may be the best ever put on film; 4 - Spectacular color (please get this latest 2-disc DVD), and 5 - of course, simply a very entertaining film start-to-finish.A few side comments: Kelly gets the legacy with his title song dance but O'Connor's dancing in here is just as good.

In fact, none of the movie made sense at all until I watched the special features that contained interviews with some of those originally associated with the movie.Then it all became clear: One interviewee pointed out that the film was created purely as a vehicle to string some promising songs together, as well as to try and recycle a couple of duds that had bombed in the hope they would be better received on this outing.And that is exactly what the movie looks like - a disjointed collection of 'music videos' strung together into a contrived story.Lots of other movies or stage shows have taken the same tack, such as the Abba musical Mama Mia. And while they may be harmless fun, they would not qualify as 'great' musicals in the way that the truly great musicals can - where music and story are brilliantly woven together into a beautiful fabric that is better than either the story or the music could be on its own.It has some merit as an example of an early advertising vehicle, where the threat posed by product pitches in distorting and destroying art was not yet fully understood. But any reasonably critical view of this film at that time should have stopped this poor film and that tragic trend in their tracks.As it turned out, audiences were prepared to accept and even celebrate the mediocre in order to fawn over favorite celebrities.
